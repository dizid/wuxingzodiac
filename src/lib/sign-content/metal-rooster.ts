  personality: {
    body: "The Metal Rooster operates like a precision instrument—calibrated, uncompromising, and brutally accurate. Metal amplifies the Rooster's natural tendency toward exactitude into something approaching religious fervor. You don't just notice errors; you're physically compelled to correct them. This isn't petty nitpicking—it's an almost painful awareness of how things should be versus how they are. Your standards aren't high; they're architectural. You build frameworks of excellence and expect everyone to inhabit them.\n\nYour Metal element gives you structural thinking that cuts through noise like a surgical blade. Where other Roosters might be performative or concerned with appearances, you care only about objective quality. You assess situations with geometric precision, identifying flaws invisible to others. This makes you invaluable in roles requiring quality control, strategic planning, or any domain where mediocrity has real consequences. You're the editor who catches the logical inconsistency on page 247, the architect who notices the load-bearing miscalculation, the analyst who spots the fatal assumption everyone else accepted.\n\nBut Metal's rigidity makes you inflexible in ways that damage relationships and limit your own growth. You confuse your standards with universal truth. What feels like integrity to you reads as judgmental harshness to others. Your directness—untempered by Fire's warmth or Water's adaptability—lands like a hammer. You state observations as if they're neutral facts, genuinely baffled when people react emotionally. \"I'm just being honest\" is your battle cry, unaware that honesty without calibration is just cruelty with better branding.\n\nYour Yin energy creates an interesting paradox: internally, you're deeply reflective and self-critical, yet externally you project certainty. You've internalized Metal's demand for perfection so thoroughly that you hold yourself to impossible standards, then export that same harshness outward. This combination makes you both admirable and exhausting—a person of genuine excellence who struggles to make others feel safe enough to reach for it.",

  shadow: {
    body: "Your shadow is control masked as competence. You believe your way isn't just better—it's correct, and deviations aren't preferences but mistakes. This makes you domineering in subtle ways. You don't yell or demand; you simply correct, repeatedly, wearing people down with relentless adjustment. Your Metal element has calcified into brittleness—you break rather than bend, fracture relationships rather than compromise standards.\n\nYou weaponize your competence. When threatened or insecure, you become hypercritical, finding flaws to reassert superiority. You keep mental ledgers of others' errors, deploying them strategically in conflicts. Your precision becomes persecution. The same discernment that makes you excellent becomes the tool you use to diminish others, maintaining hierarchy through constant evaluation.\n\nWorst of all, you confuse efficiency with virtue. You optimize everything, including human connection, and wonder why relationships feel transactional. You schedule spontaneity, plan authenticity, and critique people for not meeting standards they never agreed to. Your inability to tolerate imperfection extends to yourself—you experience normal human limitation as moral failure, creating an internal pressure that either explodes outward as criticism or implodes as anxiety and rigidity.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You need partners who can receive your precision without internalizing it as rejection. Earth signs work best—they're grounded enough not to crumble under your standards and patient enough to endure your correction process. You're testing people constantly, though you don't realize it. Every interaction is an assessment. This exhausts partners who need unconditional acceptance.\n\nYou mistake critique for intimacy. You believe helping someone improve is love's highest expression, unable to grasp that sometimes people need acceptance of who they are now, not a blueprint for who they could become. Your relationships improve dramatically when you learn to separate observation from prescription—to notice without needing to fix.\n\nYou're fiercely loyal once committed, but your commitment comes with terms and conditions. You need someone who can call out your harshness without triggering your defensive superiority, who can say \"you're being an asshole\" in ways you can actually hear. You also need explicit permission to offer feedback; your tendency to give unsolicited improvement advice poisons otherwise healthy connections. Learn to ask: \"Do you want input or just someone to listen?\" That single question could save half your relationships.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "Your excess Metal needs softening, not elimination. Cultivate Water—Metal generates Water in the productive cycle, meaning your precision can flow into adaptability rather than rigidity. Practice identifying multiple right answers instead of the single correct one. Literally list three valid approaches to situations where you'd normally see one.\n\nEngage with Wood energy through creative practices that have no quality benchmark—bad poetry, ugly painting, anything that trains you to value process over product. Wood breaks up Metal's rigidity. Let yourself be incompetent at something regularly.\n\nPhysical practices help: Metal corresponds to autumn and contraction. You need expansion. Breath work, particularly extended exhales, helps release the chest tightness that comes from constant vigilance. Your body holds your standards as literal tension. Most importantly, practice the phrase \"that works too\" even when you see a better way. Especially then. You don't need to correct everything. The world will survive your silence.",
