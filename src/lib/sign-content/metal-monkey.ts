  personality: {
    body: "The Metal Monkey is the strategist who never stops calculating, the clever operator who combines Monkey ingenuity with Metal's ruthless precision. Where other Monkeys improvise, you engineer. Where others charm randomly, you weaponize charisma with surgical accuracy. You're the person who enters a room and immediately maps power dynamics, social hierarchies, and leverage points—not from paranoia, but from sheer analytical compulsion. Your mind is a blade that never dulls, constantly sharpening itself against new problems.\n\nMetal's discipline transforms Monkey chaos into controlled brilliance. You don't just see solutions—you see the elegant solution, the one that accomplishes three goals simultaneously while appearing effortless. This makes you exceptional in complex systems: finance, technology, political maneuvering, anywhere precision thinking meets strategic advantage. You have zero patience for sloppiness or sentimentality clouding judgment. When others dither over feelings, you've already identified the optimal path and moved on.\n\nYour wit cuts deeper than other Monkeys because Metal adds edge to clever. You don't just joke—you dissect. Your observations land with surgical precision, exposing exactly what people don't want to see about themselves or situations. This makes you simultaneously fascinating and intimidating. People admire your brilliance but can't always tell if you're helping them or studying them like specimens.\n\nYou generate Water in the elemental cycle—your sharp analysis produces flow and adaptability in others, creating possibilities from your precision. You control Wood through Metal's cutting nature, which means you instinctively prune excess, eliminate inefficiencies, and strip situations down to essentials. You're the alchemist who transmutes information into power, transforming base metal into gold through pure intellectual force.",

  shadow: {
    body: "Your strategic mind becomes Machiavellian when unchecked. You start viewing people as chess pieces, relationships as leverage, kindness as weakness to exploit. The Metal Monkey shadow is the manipulator who's so clever they forget why connection matters beyond utility. You'll engineer outcomes brilliantly while destroying trust completely, winning battles but incinerating goodwill.\n\nYour cutting analysis turns cruel. That surgical wit becomes a scalpel you use to dissect people's vulnerabilities not for insight but for sport or dominance. You'll expose someone's weakness with such precision that the damage is permanent, justified in your mind as \"just being honest\" or \"they needed to hear it.\" Metal makes you rigid—when you decide someone is inefficient or inferior, you dismiss them with finality that brooks no reconsideration.\n\nWorst: you become emotionally glacial, confusing detachment with strength. You'll pride yourself on being \"above\" feelings while actually just suppressing them until you're a brilliant, lonely machine. The alchemist who transmutes everything into gold discovers gold is cold, and they've forgotten how to generate warmth.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You need partners who challenge your intellect without threatening your autonomy—Water types who flow around your sharp edges, or Earth types who ground your schemes without demanding you dull your blade. You're loyal when you respect someone's mind, but respect is earned through demonstrated competence, not emotional appeals.\n\nIn love, you show care through problem-solving and strategic support rather than conventional affection. You'll reorganize someone's entire life for efficiency before you'll say \"I love you.\" This confuses partners who need verbal reassurance, but those who speak your language recognize the devotion in your precision.\n\nYou clash with Fire types who demand emotional immediacy you can't provide, and with Wood types whose expansive chaos offends your need for control. You need people who understand that your analysis isn't coldness—it's how you care. When you take someone apart verbally to understand them better, that's intimacy in your language. The relationship challenge: learning that not everyone wants to be understood that thoroughly, and sometimes warmth matters more than accuracy.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "Balance excess Metal by deliberately engaging Water activities—anything flowing, adaptive, non-linear. Take long walks without destination. Practice improvisation where precision doesn't matter. Let conversations meander without steering them toward conclusions.\n\nCultivate Wood energy to prevent over-control: creative projects where mess is part of the process, gardening where you can't engineer every outcome. Allow some inefficiency to exist without immediately optimizing it.\n\nPhysically: swimming, tai chi, anything requiring fluid movement rather than mechanical precision. Socially: practice one conversation per week where you don't analyze the other person, just experience them. Your intellect is a weapon—learn when to sheathe it.",
