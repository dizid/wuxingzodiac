  personality: {
    body: "You are the garden that feeds the village. Earth doubles down on the Pig's natural generosity, transforming indulgence into something genuinely productive. While other Pigs might spoil themselves, you build tangible abundance—the friend who cooks for twelve, the colleague who maintains the shared resources everyone depends on, the partner who creates actual sanctuary rather than just talking about comfort. You don't just enjoy life's pleasures; you cultivate them systematically so others can partake.\n\nYour genius lies in making prosperity look effortless. Earth's stabilizing influence means you understand delayed gratification better than other Pigs, willing to tend the soil before expecting harvest. You're the person who preps meals for the week, maintains the community garden, remembers everyone's dietary restrictions, and somehow makes hosting look easy. This isn't performative—you genuinely find satisfaction in creating conditions where everyone can thrive. Where Fire Pig burns hot with enthusiasm and Water Pig flows toward pleasure, you build the infrastructure of comfort.\n\nThe Pig's infamous tolerance becomes profound acceptance in your hands. You don't just overlook differences—you actively make space for them. The weird colleague, the difficult family member, the stray cats and struggling friends—you create room at your table without making it feel like charity. This comes from Earth's centering nature: you're secure enough in your own ground that others' chaos doesn't destabilize you. But this same stability can calcify into stubborn immobility.\n\nYou work hard, often harder than you admit. Earth Pigs frequently end up as the backbone of their workplaces or families, the one everyone leans on because you never seem to break. The danger is that you confuse providing for people with proving your worth. Unlike Wood Pig's idealistic service or Metal Pig's dutiful responsibility, your caretaking stems from a need to be the indispensable foundation—and that's where trouble starts.",

  shadow: {
    body: "Your generosity curdles into enabling when left unchecked. You feed the people who should be learning to feed themselves, create comfort for those who need discomfort to grow, and mistake being needed for being valued. Earth's desire for stability means you'll maintain dysfunctional situations because changing them feels like an earthquake. You keep the alcoholic uncle at holiday dinners, let the lazy roommate slide on rent again, stay in the job where you're overworked and underpaid—all because disruption feels more threatening than exploitation.\n\nThe real shadow: you use abundance as control. By being the provider, you maintain centrality. People who depend on your cooking, your resources, your emotional labor can't easily leave, and part of you knows this. When someone tries to become independent, you might subtly undermine it—offering help they didn't ask for, questioning their capability, or guilt-tripping their departure. The Pig's love of comfort becomes a gilded cage you build around others.\n\nComplacency is your default mode when stressed. Rather than confront problems, you simply eat, shop, or indulge them into temporary oblivion. Earth's inertia means you can sit in stagnation for years, slowly accumulating resentment and weight while convincing yourself everything is fine because nothing has actively collapsed yet.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You attract people who want softness, but you need partners who won't exploit it. In relationships, you're the cook, the therapist, the mortgage co-signer, the one who remembers everyone's birthdays—and you need someone who notices this labor and reciprocates tangibly, not just verbally. Empty gratitude insults you. You want partners who show up with actions: who handle the car maintenance, who plan the vacation, who take over when you're depleted without needing detailed instructions.\n\nYour tendency is to date projects—people with potential who just need support. Stop. You can't grow someone else's backbone for them. Earth Pig's ideal match understands that your nurturing isn't bottomless and actively protects your energy from takers. You thrive with partners who have their own stability and simply want to combine gardens, not move into yours rent-free.\n\nSexually, you need more initiation than you admit. The Pig's sensual nature is real, but Earth makes you passive, waiting to be desired rather than expressing desire. This breeds resentment when partners don't read your mind. Speak your needs explicitly. In friendship, you must practice receiving. Let people cook for you. Accept help without immediately reciprocating. True intimacy requires admitting you're not the infinite resource you pretend to be.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "Add Metal to refine boundaries—learn to say no without guilt. Take up practices that require precision: woodworking, editing, martial arts forms. Metal cuts through Earth's tendency to absorb everyone's problems. Incorporate Wood to prevent stagnation: schedule disruption deliberately through travel, learning new skills, or changing routines before they calcify. Wood breaks up Earth's compaction.\n\nPhysically, you need movement more than you want it. Earth Pigs tend toward sedentary comfort—this isn't rest, it's rot. Walk daily, preferably on actual earth. Garden with your hands in soil, which paradoxically helps discharge excess Earth through direct contact. Reduce sweet and starchy foods when you're stressed; you're literally trying to earth yourself with more earth, which just creates mud. Fast intermittently to practice voluntary scarcity. Most crucially: delegate. Force others to provide occasionally, even if they do it worse than you. Competence isn't worth burnout.",
