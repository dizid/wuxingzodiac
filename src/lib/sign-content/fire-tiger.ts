  personality: {
    body: "You are double yang intensity incarnate—Fire amplifying the Tiger's already ferocious nature into a blazing spectacle of audacity. Where other Tigers stalk methodically, you charge headfirst into challenges with flames trailing behind you. You don't just break rules; you incinerate the rulebook entirely, often before reading it. Your confidence borders on the supernatural—you genuinely believe you can accomplish the impossible, and your sheer conviction often makes it so.\n\nFire transforms, and you transform everything you touch. Static situations offend you. You enter stagnant organizations and immediately start burning away dead wood, forcing evolution whether people are ready or not. Your charisma is incendiary—people either catch fire from your enthusiasm or flee from the heat. There's no middle ground with you. You're the person who quits a stable job to start three businesses simultaneously, who books flights before checking their bank account, who proposes revolutionary ideas in meetings where everyone else brought incremental improvements.\n\nYour decision-making speed terrifies more cautious types. While they're still gathering data, you've already acted, failed, pivoted, and succeeded at something completely different. You operate on instinct and passion, trusting your gut with religious fervor. This makes you exceptional in crisis situations—when everything's on fire anyway, your comfort with chaos becomes a tactical advantage. You're the leader people follow into battles they'd normally avoid, because your certainty is intoxicating.\n\nBut you're not just aggressive heat. Fire also brings joy, celebration, and radiance. You make ordinary moments feel epic. A casual dinner becomes a memorable event through your storytelling. Your laughter is contagious, your enthusiasm genuine. You celebrate others' victories as loudly as your own, generating warmth that draws people into your orbit. You don't dim yourself for anyone's comfort—you blaze authentically, and people either love or hate you for it.",

  shadow: {
    body: "Your most destructive pattern is confusing motion with progress. You burn through relationships, jobs, and opportunities at an unsustainable rate, leaving scorched earth behind you. Fire consumes—and you consume resources, goodwill, and people's patience faster than you can replenish them. You start projects with explosive enthusiasm, then abandon them the moment they require tedious maintenance work, leaving others to clean up your unfinished combustion.\n\nYour temper is volcanic. When crossed, you don't get angry—you become wrath itself, saying scorching things you can't unsay, burning bridges you'll later wish you'd preserved. You mistake intensity for intimacy, overwhelming people with heat when they needed gentle warmth. You also struggle with anything that requires sustained, quiet effort. Patience feels like defeat to you. You'd rather force a dramatic confrontation than endure strategic waiting, often turning minor issues into relationship-ending infernos through sheer impatience. Your need for constant stimulation makes you dangerously prone to self-sabotage—setting fires just to have something exciting to fight.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You need partners who can match your intensity without getting consumed by it. You're drawn to people who have their own internal fire—equals who challenge you rather than admirers who simply reflect your light. You fall fast and burn hot, but you respect partners who maintain their own identity rather than merging into your flame.\n\nYour love language is grand gestures and passionate declarations. Subtle affection confuses you. You'd rather have explosive arguments followed by dramatic reconciliations than polite, unresolved tension. This exhausts partners who prefer emotional stability. You need relationships with clear boundaries—people who can tell you when you're being too much without making it a referendum on your worth.\n\nYou're fiercely loyal to your inner circle, defending them with terrifying intensity. But you also demand that they keep up with your pace, which means you unconsciously filter for adventurous types. Homebodies and cautious planners rarely last in your orbit. You need partners who understand that your restlessness isn't rejection—it's just your elemental nature. Give you freedom to blaze, and you'll always return to warm yourself by your chosen relationships.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "Your excess Fire needs deliberate cooling and grounding. Water element practices are essential—literally spend time near water, take cold showers after heated moments, practice swimming or water sports. These aren't metaphors; physical proximity to Water element helps dissipate destructive heat.\n\nCultivate Earth element through completion rituals. Finish three small projects before starting new ones. Earth receives Fire's energy productively, transforming your combustion into stable creation. Garden, cook, or work with clay—activities with tangible, grounded results.\n\nBuild in mandatory rest periods. You'll resist this violently, but schedule complete downtime between major pushes. Fire requires fuel; you're burning through your own reserves. Practice one daily activity that produces absolutely nothing—meditation, floating, simple breathing. Stop treating stillness as enemy territory. Your power increases when you learn to bank your coals instead of maintaining constant inferno.",
