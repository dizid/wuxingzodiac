  personality: {
    body: "The Metal Dog is a fortress of integrity in a world of compromise. Where other Dogs might waver in their loyalties or bend their principles for comfort, Metal sharpens these qualities into something unbreakable. You don't just have values—you are your values. This isn't abstract philosophy; it shows up in how you refuse to cut corners on projects, how you'll speak uncomfortable truths in meetings when everyone else nods along, how you maintain standards even when lowering them would make life easier.\n\nMetal's autumn energy brings a harvesting discernment to the Dog's protective instincts. You assess people and situations with surgical precision, identifying weaknesses, inconsistencies, and threats others miss entirely. This makes you an exceptional guardian—whether protecting a team, a family, or an ideal. You see the cracks in arguments, the flaws in plans, the dangers lurking in seemingly safe choices. Your warnings aren't paranoid; they're usually correct. The problem is that being right doesn't always make you popular.\n\nYour discipline borders on the martial. Where Wood Dogs might crusade with passionate speeches and Earth Dogs build through patient service, you enforce through structure and accountability. You create systems, establish protocols, insist on excellence. There's a military quality to how you operate—not in harshness necessarily, but in precision. Meetings start on time. Commitments are honored. Standards are maintained. You bring order to chaos not through control but through example, and you hold yourself to the same exacting standards you expect from others.\n\nThe Yang energy makes you direct, sometimes startlingly so. You don't soften criticism with diplomatic cushioning or hide disappointment behind polite smiles. When someone violates your trust or fails to meet their obligations, they know it. This transparency can be refreshing—people always know where they stand with you—but it can also be intimidating. You generate Water in the cycle, meaning your clarity can flow into wisdom, but only if you don't freeze into rigid judgment first.",

  shadow: {
    body: "Your greatest strength weaponized becomes your harshest limitation. That unwavering integrity curdles into judgmental inflexibility. You don't just disagree with people who have different standards—you write them off entirely. The coworker who's five minutes late isn't just tardy; they're fundamentally disrespectful. The friend who changes plans isn't being flexible; they're unreliable. You sort people into categories of worthy and unworthy with the finality of a judge's gavel, and once someone lands in the unworthy column, redemption is nearly impossible.\n\nMetal's controlling nature over Wood means you can cut down growing things before they have a chance to develop. You criticize nascent ideas, dismiss experimental approaches, shut down enthusiasm with premature evaluation. Your need for precision kills spontaneity. Your focus on what's wrong blinds you to what's possible. Teams become afraid to take risks around you because one mistake confirms their inadequacy in your eyes.\n\nWorst is when your protective instincts become paranoid gatekeeping. You're so focused on threats that you create a bunker mentality, viewing outsiders with automatic suspicion, resisting change as inherently dangerous, mistaking caution for wisdom. You don't just guard boundaries—you fortify them until nothing new can enter. Relationships suffocate under your standards. Projects stagnate under your scrutiny. And you stand alone, righteous and isolated, wondering why others won't simply do things correctly.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You need partners who can handle unvarnished honesty without crumbling. Emotional manipulators and people who require constant reassurance will exhaust you; you don't have patience for games or fragility. What you offer is fierce, unwavering loyalty—once you commit, you're all in, protecting and supporting with relentless dedication. But earning that commitment requires proving reliability. You watch how people handle small responsibilities because it reveals how they'll handle large ones.\n\nYour ideal match understands that your criticism comes from caring, not cruelty. You point out the error in your partner's business plan because you want them to succeed, not because you enjoy being right. You insist on honesty in difficult conversations because you believe relationships require truth, not comfort. Partners who can receive your directness as devotion rather than attack will find you extraordinarily dependable.\n\nThe challenge is learning that different doesn't mean deficient. Your partner's more relaxed approach to time management isn't a character flaw; it's a different operating system. Your friend's willingness to give second chances isn't naivety; it's a different risk calculation. Relationships thrive when you can extend the same loyalty you demand—accepting people's essential nature rather than requiring they meet your specifications. You generate Water; let your clarity become depth rather than ice.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "To prevent Metal from becoming brittle, you need deliberate softening practices. Earth generates Metal—spend time with Earth types who demonstrate how strength can coexist with flexibility, how standards can be maintained without rigidity. Physical practices that require yielding rather than forcing work well: swimming, tai chi, activities where relaxation produces better results than tension.\n\nMetal generates Water, so cultivate reflective practices that transform your sharp discernment into fluid wisdom. Journal about times you were wrong. Study situations where your initial judgment missed important context. This isn't about doubting yourself—it's about adding nuance to your precision. Schedule deliberate moments to withhold judgment, to observe without immediately evaluating. Let information settle before you crystallize conclusions.\n\nConsciously practice the harvest metaphor of autumn: discernment about what to keep doesn't require destroying what you release. You can decide someone isn't right for your team without condemning their entire character. You can maintain boundaries without building walls. The goal isn't to become less principled—it's to ensure your principles serve life rather than becoming a prison of perfection.",
