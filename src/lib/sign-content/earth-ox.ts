  personality: {
    body: "The Earth Ox is the most immovable force in the zodiac—double earth energy creates a person who embodies permanence itself. You don't just resist change; you are the foundation upon which others build their lives. Where other Oxen might eventually bend, you simply don't. This isn't weakness disguised as strength—it's geological time operating at human speed. You make decisions slowly, implement them methodically, and never, ever deviate from the path once it's set.\n\nYour approach to life is agricultural in the truest sense. You understand that worthwhile things take seasons, not moments. While others chase trends and pivot constantly, you're cultivating something that will outlast them all. This makes you exceptional at任务 that require sustained effort over years—building businesses brick by brick, raising children with consistent values, maintaining traditions that would otherwise disappear. You're not interested in innovation for its own sake; you want to know what works, what's proven, what will still be standing when the flashy new thing has crumbled.\n\nEarth's nurturing quality manifests in your fierce protectiveness of your people and your systems. You don't express care through words or grand gestures—you express it by showing up, every single day, doing the unglamorous work that keeps everything functioning. You're the person who remembers to pay the insurance, maintain the equipment, save for emergencies that haven't happened yet. Others find this boring until crisis hits and you're the only one still standing.\n\nYour stubbornness is legendary because it's rooted in something deeper than ego—it's existential. Changing your mind feels like erosion, like losing yourself particle by particle. You'd rather be wrong consistently than right inconsistently, because consistency is your religion. This makes you trustworthy to the point of predictability, which is either your greatest asset or your defining limitation depending on who's evaluating you.",
  },
  shadow: {
    body: "Your inflexibility crosses into obstruction when you mistake immobility for wisdom. You don't just resist bad ideas—you resist all new ideas with equal force, treating innovation and foolishness as synonyms. This makes you the person who insists on doing things the hard way because 'that's how we've always done it,' even when better methods exist. Your refusal to adapt becomes a form of passive aggression against reality itself.\n\nThe double earth element creates a density that can feel like emotional constipation. You don't process feelings—you bury them under layers of routine and responsibility until they calcify into resentment. You'll nurse a grudge for decades, not out of active malice, but because letting go feels like instability. Your relationships suffer because you confuse 'unchanging' with 'loyal'—you'll stay in situations long past their expiration date, turning commitment into imprisonment.\n\nYour worst behavior emerges as judgmental rigidity. You view people who adapt, pivot, or change their minds as weak or flaky. You hoard resources and information because sharing feels like depletion. You become the immovable object that others must navigate around rather than work with, creating isolation disguised as independence.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You need partners who understand that your steadiness isn't emotional unavailability—it's love expressed through constancy. You won't give flowery speeches, but you'll drive through a blizzard to keep a commitment made months ago. Your ideal match appreciates reliability over romance and shares your long-term orientation.\n\nThe challenge is that your earth energy can smother more dynamic personalities. You need someone who won't mistake your stability for permission to be chaotic, but who also won't enable your resistance to all change. Metal signs work well because they need your foundation to manifest their precision—you generate metal in the elemental cycle, providing the stable base from which they can create structure.\n\nYou struggle with wood signs who need growth and expansion—you instinctively control wood in the cycle, seeing their restlessness as threat to your carefully maintained order. Fire signs exhaust you because you instinctively nurture them (earth generates fire), and their consumption can feel bottomless. You need relationships where your giving has natural limits and your stubbornness is occasionally challenged without being constantly attacked.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "Your earth excess needs metal to give it structure and direction—all that stability becomes stagnation without purpose. Take up practices that require precision and refinement: woodworking, metalworking, detailed craftsmanship that transforms your raw endurance into something crystallized and beautiful. Introduce wood energy through literal growth—tend plants, work with living systems that force you to adapt to their rhythms rather than imposing yours.\n\nPhysically, you need to move the density. Weight training, hiking with heavy loads, activities that honor your strength while preventing complete rigidity. The goal isn't flexibility for its own sake—it's maintaining functional range while preserving your essential nature. Set one small thing each month you'll do differently, not to change who you are, but to prove you can bend without breaking.",
