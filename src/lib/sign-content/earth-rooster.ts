  personality: {
    body: "You're the project manager everyone wishes they had — competent, grounded, and constitutionally incapable of half-assing anything. Earth steadies the Rooster's natural precision, turning what could be finicky micromanagement into genuine mastery of systems and processes. You don't just organize closets; you create sustainable organizational frameworks that others can actually follow. Your Yin energy means you perfect through careful observation rather than loud proclamation, though you'll absolutely speak up when standards slip.\n\nEarth's stabilizing influence channels the Rooster's critical eye into practical improvement rather than nitpicking for sport. You see inefficiency like other people see typos — it physically bothers you until you fix it. But unlike Metal Roosters who enforce standards through rigid rules, you build them into the foundation itself. You create environments where excellence becomes the natural default, not a constant struggle. People trust your judgment because you've clearly thought through every angle, tested every assumption, and built in contingency plans they didn't know they needed.\n\nYour diligence isn't performative hustle — it's the steady accumulation of small, correct actions over time. Earth generates Metal in the cycle, so you naturally create structures that endure. You're building cathedrals while others are putting up tents. This makes you exceptionally valuable in any role requiring both attention to detail and long-term vision. You can see how today's careful work becomes next year's advantage. The challenge is that your high standards can make you isolated; not everyone operates at your level of thoroughness, and you have limited patience for those who won't even try.",
  },
  shadow: {
    body: "Your perfectionism calcifies into rigidity. Earth's stability becomes stubbornness when you decide there's only one right way — yours — to complete a task. You'll redo someone else's adequate work to meet your exact specifications, creating resentment and bottlenecks. Your critical nature, meant to elevate standards, can become a weapon that makes others feel perpetually insufficient. You control through withholding approval, creating environments where people walk on eggshells waiting for your judgment.\n\nEarth controlling Water means you can dam up emotional flow entirely, becoming the stoic who mistakes emotional unavailability for strength. You suppress not just your feelings but others', dismissing emotional needs as inefficient distractions from the work. This creates brittle relationships that function fine until crisis hits, then shatter because there's no emotional foundation. Your diligence becomes workaholism, and you judge those who maintain better boundaries as lazy. You become the bitter expert who knows the right way to do everything but can't understand why no one wants to work with you.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You show love through acts of service and practical support, but partners need to understand that your advice is affection, not criticism. When you point out a better way to load the dishwasher, you're trying to make their life easier, not attacking their competence. You need someone who appreciates your reliability without taking it for granted — your steady presence is a gift, not a given.\n\nEarth energy makes you devoted but not demonstrative. You prove commitment through showing up consistently, managing household systems efficiently, and remembering important details. You struggle with partners who need constant verbal reassurance or spontaneous romantic gestures; that's not your language. Your ideal match either speaks your practical love language or is secure enough not to need constant validation. You're attracted to people who respect expertise and continuous improvement, but you need to occasionally value connection over correction. Your relationships thrive when you remember that people aren't projects to be optimized.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "Generate Metal deliberately: document your systems, create templates others can use, mentor someone through your methodology. This productive cycle move prevents stagnation. Control Water mindfully: schedule emotional check-ins like calendar appointments, practice voicing feelings even when they seem illogical, allow yourself rest without justifying its productivity. Strengthen Earth without excess: spend time in actual nature (not your perfectly organized garden — wilderness with no human improvement), work with your hands in ways that have no measurable outcome like pottery or baking. Let yourself make something adequate rather than perfect once a week. Practice approving others' different-but-functional methods without correcting them. Your power grows when your standards elevate rather than isolate.",
