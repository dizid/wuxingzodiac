  personality: {
    body: "The Fire Rooster is a walking contradiction resolved: meticulous attention to detail delivered with theatrical flair. Where other Roosters organize quietly, you orchestrate with spotlights blazing. Fire transforms the Rooster's natural precision into visible spectacle—every spreadsheet color-coded, every presentation polished to reflection, every standard raised just high enough to impress. You don't just have opinions; you have manifestos. You don't just complete projects; you debut them.\n\nYour Fire element generates Earth in the productive cycle, meaning your passionate perfectionism creates tangible results. You build systems that actually work, standards that elevate entire teams, presentations that shift thinking. Unlike Metal Roosters who perfect for perfection's sake, your drive serves transformation. You genuinely want improvement—not just compliance—and your enthusiasm about excellence is infectious when channeled correctly. People remember your energy before they remember your critiques.\n\nYin energy keeps your Fire from pure volatility. You're not the Fire Horse charging ahead recklessly or the Fire Dragon dominating through force. Your flame focuses inward first—intense self-examination before external judgment. This creates a strange dynamic: you're simultaneously your harshest critic and your boldest promoter. You'll obsess over a minor flaw in your work, then present it with absolute confidence anyway. You perform perfectionism rather than hide behind it.\n\nThe danger is when performance replaces substance. Fire craves visibility, and Rooster nature craves correctness—together they can prioritize looking right over being right. You might polish a flawed concept until it shines rather than scrap it and start over. Your criticism becomes less about improvement and more about maintaining your position as the discerning authority. When insecure, you pick at details publicly to demonstrate your exacting standards, forgetting that real mastery knows when precision matters and when it's just noise.",
  },
  shadow: {
    body: "Your shadow emerges when Fire's need for recognition hijacks Rooster's service to quality. You start critiquing to be seen as the expert rather than to actually improve outcomes. The compulsion to correct becomes performative—interrupting meetings to note minor errors, sending emails pointing out trivial inconsistencies, offering unsolicited advice to demonstrate your superior discernment. You confuse being impressive with being helpful.\n\nFire controls Metal in the destructive cycle, and when unbalanced, you use your charisma to cut others down. Your criticisms arrive wrapped in entertainment—a witty takedown that gets laughs while demolishing someone's confidence. You justify it as maintaining standards, but really you're feeding your Fire's hunger for attention. The audience reaction matters more than whether your feedback creates growth.\n\nWorst is when you double down on mistakes rather than admit them. Fire Roosters hate being visibly wrong because it threatens both accuracy (Rooster) and image (Fire). So you'll argue semantics, blame circumstances, or retroactively claim you meant something different. You'll defend a bad decision with increasingly elaborate justifications rather than simply acknowledge the miss and move forward.",
  },
  relationships: {
    body: "You need partners who appreciate your intensity without requiring constant performance. Someone who recognizes that beneath the confident critiques lives genuine anxiety about meeting your own standards. You're drawn to people who can receive your feedback without deflating and give you honest critique without wounding your pride—a narrow target.\n\nIn close relationships, you're surprisingly generous with your energy and attention. Fire Roosters love to help partners excel, offering detailed observations and enthusiastic coaching. But you struggle when your advice isn't implemented exactly as suggested. You interpret it as rejection of your care rather than just differing approaches. You need explicit acknowledgment: \"I value your perspective even when I do things differently.\"\n\nYour Fire element generates Earth, so you naturally nurture through structure—creating systems that support others' success, organizing shared responsibilities, building frameworks for mutual growth. But you also control Metal, meaning you can be cutting when feeling undervalued. A partner who lets you shine publicly while keeping you humble privately manages your elemental balance perfectly. You crave audiences but need witnesses—people who see through the performance to the perfectionist just trying to get things right.",
  },
  elementBalance: {
    body: "Balance excess Fire by deliberately practicing imperfect visibility. Post the rough draft. Share the half-formed idea. Present without polishing. Your Fire burns too hot when every output becomes a performance piece, so practice showing process over product.\n\nEngage Metal element activities: work with your hands on projects where precision serves function, not image. Woodworking, repair work, cooking without recipes—things where quality emerges through attention rather than presentation. Metal tempers Fire when you let it.\n\nCultivate Wood element by prioritizing growth over correctness. Choose learning over knowing. When you catch yourself correcting someone, ask a question instead. Wood feeds Fire sustainably; performing expertise burns you out. Schedule regular \"amateur hour\" where you deliberately do something you're mediocre at, reconnecting with the vulnerability that makes your standards meaningful rather than tyrannical.",
