# Wu Xing Zodiac — Video Prompts

60 abstract/atmospheric video clips for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels.

## How to Use

**Tool**: Kling AI (best cost/quality for abstract visuals). Also works in Runway Gen-4 or Minimax.
**Settings**: 9:16 vertical, 10s duration, High Quality mode
**Workflow**: Copy prompt below → paste into Kling → tweak wording if needed → generate → review

Each prompt is self-contained — just copy and paste. All prompts share the same dark cinematic brand feel but vary by element (color/environment) and animal (abstract motif).

## Brand Style Reference

These rules are already baked into every prompt below. This section is just for reference if you want to write your own variations.

- **Background**: Near-black void (#0a0a0a), deep cinematic darkness
- **Light source**: Single element-colored glow as primary light — no white/neutral lighting
- **Surfaces**: Translucent glass morphism panels, frosted edges, soft inner glow
- **Chinese characters**: Floating, luminous, semi-transparent — part of the environment, not text overlay
- **Camera**: Slow, meditative movement (push-in, orbital, rising crane) — never fast or jerky
- **Mood**: Mystical, ancient, powerful — NOT cartoonish, NOT fortune-teller kitsch
- **No people, no text overlays, no UI elements** — pure abstract atmosphere
- **Particles**: Always present, element-specific (embers, leaves, dust, crystals, droplets)

## Test Prompts (3 of 60)

### FIRE — Fire Horse 丙午 — The Untamable Spirit

> Cinematic dark void, near-black background. A vast volcanic plain stretches into darkness, its cracked surface glowing with veins of molten orange and gold light pulsing beneath. Rising from the ground, trails of wild ember sparks streak upward in sweeping arcs — the ghost of a galloping horse traced in fire, untamed and explosive. The luminous Chinese characters 丙午 float mid-air, burning with intense orange-gold radiance, their edges flickering like living flame. Translucent glass shards hover nearby, catching and refracting the volcanic glow. Tiny embers drift everywhere like fireflies in a furnace. The heat haze warps the air. Slow orbital camera movement circling the ember trails. Cinematic 4K, shallow depth of field, dark atmospheric, no people, no text overlay.

### WATER — Water Rat 壬子 — The Fluid Strategist

> Cinematic dark void, near-black background. Deep underwater darkness, illuminated by shifting sapphire-blue caustic light rippling across invisible surfaces. Small darting particles of bioluminescent light weave through the scene in quick, purposeful patterns — clever trajectories that suggest calculation, like a network of moving intelligence mapping the dark. The luminous Chinese characters 壬子 drift through the water column, glowing cool blue with soft sky-blue halos, their forms gently distorted by the current. A translucent glass sphere hovers in the center, refracting the caustic patterns into concentrated points of light. Tiny silver bubbles rise in spiraling streams. The water pulses with a slow, rhythmic current. Slow push-in camera toward the glass sphere. Cinematic 4K, shallow depth of field, dark atmospheric, no people, no text overlay.

### WOOD — Wood Tiger 甲寅 — The Compassionate Adventurer

> Cinematic dark void, near-black background. An ancient forest floor in deep darkness, lit only by emerald-green bioluminescent moss and vines that pulse with living light. Three luminous claw marks slash through the air, carved from green light — bold and powerful but surrounded by gently unfurling fern fronds and soft spring mist, strength meeting tenderness. The luminous Chinese characters 甲寅 hover among the canopy, glowing warm emerald with pale green halos, wrapped in slowly growing vine tendrils. Translucent glass leaves drift downward, catching the bioluminescence. Tiny floating spores and firefly-like particles drift through shafts of green light. The moss pulses gently as if breathing. Slow rising crane camera through the forest canopy. Cinematic 4K, shallow depth of field, dark atmospheric, no people, no text overlay.
