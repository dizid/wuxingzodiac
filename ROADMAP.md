# Roadmap — Wu Xing Zodiac

## Reality Check: Why the Current Model Doesn't Work

### Unit Economics (Merch via Paid Traffic)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Shirt price | ~$30 |
| Profit per sale | ~$10 |
| Conversion rate | ~1% |
| Google Ads CPC (niche) | ~$0.50 |
| Cost per 1,000 visitors | ~$500 |
| Sales per 1,000 visitors | ~10 |
| Revenue per 1,000 visitors | $100 |
| **Net per 1,000 visitors** | **-$400** |

You'd need $0.10 CPC or 5% conversion to break even. Neither is realistic for apparel.

### What's Not Defensible

- **AI-generated content** — Google penalizes mass-produced AI sites. 60 templated sign pages with swapped keywords is exactly what gets flagged.
- **Zodiac tools** — A calculator and compatibility checker have zero moat. Anyone can build them in an afternoon.
- **SEO-only strategy** — Risky when the entire site is AI-generated content in a commoditized niche.
- **Low-margin physical merch** — $10 profit per shirt can't absorb any meaningful customer acquisition cost.

## Revised Strategy

Stop thinking "content site that sells shirts." Start thinking "identity brand with multiple revenue angles."

### 1. Brand > Content

The zodiac niche has one unique property: **people identify with their sign**. "I'm a Fire Horse" is an identity statement, not a Google search.

Build around identity:
- Shareable "I'm a [sign]" content people post voluntarily
- Zodiac pairs content ("tag your Fire Horse friend")
- The art style (sumi-e ink wash) IS the brand — it's distinctive and not commodity

### 2. Social-First Distribution (Free Traffic)

Paid ads don't work. SEO is a gamble. Social is free and zodiac content is inherently viral.

| Platform | Why |
|----------|-----|
| TikTok/Reels | "What your Chinese zodiac says about you" format — proven viral template |
| Pinterest | Zodiac aesthetic content has massive search volume, long shelf life |
| Reddit | r/astrology, r/ChineseZodiac — community engagement, backlinks |

The content isn't the site pages — it's short-form social that drives traffic to the site.

### 3. Digital Products > Physical Products

| Product | Margin | CAC tolerance |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| $30 shirt, $10 profit | 33% | Almost none |
| $9 PDF birth chart | ~100% | Much higher |
| $19 personalized reading | ~100% | Even higher |
| Free newsletter → paid tier | ~100% | Infinite (organic) |

The Blueprint report ($9.99) already exists in the codebase. Prioritize getting that live over expanding the shirt catalog.

### 4. The Site as Lead Gen for Dizid

One web development client ($5K+) is worth more than years of shirt sales. The site demonstrates:
- Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind expertise
- SSG/SSR and SEO implementation
- E-commerce integration
- Content management systems

### 5. Email List is the Real Asset

Newsletter subscribers are free to reach, repeatedly. The Buttondown integration already exists. Build the list aggressively — it's the only channel you fully own.

## Priorities (What to Do Next)

### Now (High Impact, Low Effort)

1. **Ship the Blueprint PDF product** — digital, near-100% margin, infrastructure half-built
2. **Set up TikTok/Reels** — test 5-10 zodiac identity videos, measure organic reach
3. **Grow the email list** — every page should have a newsletter CTA, offer the calculator result as bait
4. **Price shirts at $35** — zodiac personalization justifies a premium, $15 profit is 50% more per sale

### Soon (Build the Flywheel)

5. **Pinterest strategy** — pin the sumi-e artwork, zodiac trait graphics, compatibility results
6. **Retargeting only** — if running any paid ads, pixel site visitors and retarget warm audiences ($50-100/mo max)
7. **Expand digital products** — compatibility reports for pairs, annual horoscope PDFs, element guides
8. **Ship the 5 MVP shirts** — but don't expand to 60. Let organic demand signal which signs to add

### Later (If Traction)

9. **Community features** — comments, user profiles, "find your zodiac match"
10. **Content depth over breadth** — 12 genuinely deep animal pages > 60 thin sign pages
11. **firehorse.info as authority play** — one deep niche site with real expertise, cross-linking to wuxingzodiac
12. **Expand merch on demand** — add designs only for signs with proven social/organic demand

## What NOT to Do

- Don't spend money on Google Ads for shirt sales
- Don't expand to 60 shirt designs before validating demand for 5
- Don't rely on SEO as the primary traffic channel
- Don't write more AI-generated long-form content for sign pages
- Don't build more tools (calculators, checkers) thinking they're a moat
