  "elementalIdentity": "You are the Water Dragon — the Tidal Force. Not the gentle stream, not the still pond. You are the ocean at full swell, the flood that reshapes coastlines, the deep current that moves continents of water without surface ripples betraying your power. Where other water signs adapt by yielding, you adapt by overwhelming. Where other dragons blaze and announce, you accumulate force in darkness and strike when the moment is cosmically correct.\n\nThe dragon is yang mythology made flesh — the only zodiac animal that exists in realm of pure archetype. It represents transformation, spiritual authority, and the refusal to be ordinary. But you're not the Fire Dragon's volcanic drama or the Earth Dragon's mountain permanence. You are water given wings and claws. This makes you the most psychologically complex of all dragon types, because water is yin in nature — receptive, downward-flowing, introspective — yet the dragon is maximum yang expression. You are the walking paradox: the humble emperor, the silent roarer, the dragon who rules from the depths rather than the sky.\n\nThis contradiction is your superpower and your curse. You contain genuine wisdom because water element gifts you pattern recognition that borders on prophecy. You see how energy moves through systems — social, financial, emotional — the way water finds every crack in stone. The dragon gives you the courage to act on these perceptions, but water makes you wait for the right season. You are patient in ways that terrify more impulsive signs, because your patience isn't passive. It's the patience of winter ice thickening, of pressure building behind a dam. When you finally move, structures change permanently.\n\nYour archetype is tidal because tides are not random. They answer to the moon, to gravitational logic, to cycles older than human observation. You operate by internal rhythms that others can't perceive. People mistake your stillness for uncertainty, your depth for coldness, your strategic silence for absence of opinion. They're wrong on all counts. You're simply operating on dragon time within water's element — which means you're playing a longer game than anyone else in the room is capable of understanding.\n\nThe shadow side? You can drown people with your intensity. Water dragon energy doesn't do anything halfway. When you love, you love with oceanic totality. When you withdraw, you disappear into trenches so deep no light reaches. When you're wounded, you can hold grudges with the patience of geological time, waiting years to balance scales. Your adaptability can become manipulation — you're so good at reading emotional currents that you can redirect them without people knowing they've been moved. The dragon's pride combined with water's subtlety creates someone who controls without appearing to lead, who wins arguments days after they've ended because you've shifted the entire frame of reference.",
  "elementInDepth": "Water is the element of winter, of maximum yin, of things returning to essential nature. It governs the kidneys in traditional correspondence — the organ system that manages fear, willpower, and essential jing (primal essence). For you, this manifests as an almost eerie capacity to remain functional when others panic. The dragon gives you constitutional boldness, but water gives you something rarer: the wisdom to know when boldness serves and when it wastes energy. You don't confuse motion with progress, noise with power.\n\nIn the generating cycle, Water generates Wood. This is your creative outlet, your legacy mechanism. You nurture growth — ideas, people, projects — but only those you deem worthy. You're not democratically generous. The dragon's discernment combines with water's depth perception to make you highly selective about where you invest your generative force. When you do commit, you create conditions for explosive growth. You're the investor who spots potential five years early, the mentor whose students exceed their teachers, the parent whose children become forces of nature. But this same cycle means you can be drained by excessive Wood energy — too many demands for growth, too much expected output, and you deplete your essential reserves.\n\nIn the controlling cycle, Water controls Fire. This is where your power becomes undeniable. Fire represents passion, visibility, drama, uncontrolled expansion. You extinguish it — not always intentionally, but inevitably. In groups, your presence dampens hysteria. In arguments, your cool logic undermines emotional manipulation. In markets or social movements, you're the voice asking uncomfortable questions when everyone else is caught in euphoric momentum. This makes you essential during manias and unpopular during boom times. The dragon in you wants recognition for this service; the water knows recognition comes a season late.\n\nBut Fire also challenges you. When Fire energy is directed at you — criticism, competition, aggressive yang assertion — it attempts to evaporate your water essence. Prolonged exposure to Fire-dominant environments (high-conflict workplaces, drama-saturated relationships, constantly demanding social scenes) doesn't just stress you. It fundamentally depletes you at the jing level. You need to retreat to water's natural domain: solitude, stillness, depth activities like research or contemplation. The dragon resists this need, wants to stay in the arena. Learning when to withdraw isn't cowardice — it's element wisdom.\n\nWhen your water is strong — well-rested, properly withdrawn, emotionally resourced — you're the most formidable strategist in the zodiac. Your intuition is surgical. Your timing is impeccable. Your influence spreads like ink in water, subtly recoloring everything it touches. When your water is depleted, you become either frozen (paralyzed, overthinking, unable to act despite seeing all angles) or you flood (emotional overwhelm, boundary collapse, drowning others in needs you've denied too long). The dragon's pride makes it hard to admit depletion. You'll push through exhaustion until you crack dramatically rather than rest preventatively. This is your pattern. Knowing it doesn't make it easier to break, but ignoring it guarantees the flood.",
  "yearAhead2026": "The Year of the Fire Horse arrives like a lightning storm after your winter. This is not your natural element season — Fire opposes Water in the controlling cycle, and Horse energy is maximum yang expression, speed over depth, action over contemplation. The Horse gallops; you submerge. The Horse announces; you observe. This year will challenge your fundamental operating system, and that's precisely why it matters for your development.\n\nQ1 (Winter into Spring): The year opens while you're still in seasonal favor — winter hasn't fully released its grip. Use January and February to build reserves. The dragon in you will want to explode out of the gate matching the Fire Horse's energy. Resist. This is a marathon year disguised as a sprint. By March, Fire energy intensifies as spring arrives. You'll feel the evaporation beginning — more demands on your time, more pressure to be visible, more situations requiring quick decisions rather than strategic patience. The opportunity here is learning to act with less information than you prefer. The warning is mistaking speed for sloppiness. You can move faster than usual without abandoning wisdom.\n\nQ2 (Spring into Summer): April through June is peak Fire Horse energy, and it will feel like living on dry land. Your natural adaptation mechanisms — withdrawing, going deep, waiting — will be less available. External circumstances demand presence. This is actually your power season if you flip the frame. Instead of seeing Fire energy as depleting you, see it as the force that makes your water essential. Everyone else is overheating, overcommitting, burning resources. You become the cooling presence, the strategic brake, the voice of sustainability. Position yourself as the counter-balance, not the opposition. Career moves are favored here, particularly in consulting, crisis management, or advisory roles where your pattern recognition prevents expensive mistakes others are racing toward.\n\nQ3 (Summer into Autumn): July through September brings slight relief as autumn approaches. Fire energy remains strong but the desperation edge softens. This is your season to harvest what you planted in Q2. Relationships formed earlier in the year deepen now — people remember who stayed calm when they were panicking. Financial opportunities emerge from April-June chaos as markets or industries correct. The dragon's pride will want vindication for being right about risks others ignored. Manage this carefully. Gloating depletes your water. Being sought for wisdom afterward restores it. Let people come to you.\n\nQ4 (Autumn into Winter): October through December is your recovery and planning season. Fire Horse year energy begins waning; your natural element season returns. This is when you do your real work — processing everything you observed during the Fire months, identifying the patterns that will matter in 2027 (Year of the Fire Sheep, slightly more favorable), positioning for moves that others won't see coming because they were too busy galloping to notice you were mapping the terrain. The warning for Q4 is don't collapse entirely. The dragon's tendency is all-or-nothing. You survived Fire energy; don't waste the survival by hibernating so deeply you miss the positioning window. Moderate withdrawal, not total.",
  "compatibilityMap": "You need to understand something fundamental: your compatibility isn't about finding someone similar. Water Dragon compatibility is about finding someone whose element cycle creates productive friction or sustainable generation. You're too intense for ease to ever be the highest value.\n\nBest elemental matches are Metal and Wood signs, but for completely different reasons. Metal generates Water in the cycle — Metal signs (especially Monkey, Rooster, Dog in their Metal years, but this extends to Metal-element people generally) provide the structure and refinement that gives your depth something to fill. They create the container; you provide the content. These relationships have natural flow. Metal's precision appeals to your strategic nature. Metal's ability to cut through confusion matches your ability to dissolve pretense. Together you create something sharper and deeper than either achieves alone. Romantically, Metal partners understand your need for solitude without taking it personally. They have their own projects, their own internal worlds. Sexually, there's alignment in intensity without performance pressure. The challenge with Metal is emotional coldness when both of you withdraw simultaneously — someone has to cross the gap first, and both of you resist vulnerability.\n\nWood signs (Rabbit, Tiger, particularly) represent what you generate. These relationships feel purposeful. You naturally mentor, resource, and enable Wood signs. They give you someone to pour your depth into, which satisfies the dragon's need for legacy and water's need to flow somewhere. Romantically, Wood partners bring growth energy that prevents your stagnation. They challenge you to keep evolving. The shadow side is depletion — Wood consumes Water in the generating cycle. If the Wood person is immature, demanding, or doesn't reciprocate, you'll drain yourself trying to make them grow. These relationships require clear boundaries and reciprocity agreements, or you become the ocean that a forest drinks dry.\n\nMost challenging are Fire signs (Snake, Horse, particularly). Fire attempts to evaporate Water; Water extinguishes Fire. The attraction can be intense — opposites often are — but the sustainability is questionable. You can feel like you're constantly dampening their enthusiasm or they're constantly overheating your emotional environment. Fire partners will call you cold when you're being strategic, controlling when you're being protective. You'll call them reckless when they're being passionate, exhausting when they're being energetic. These relationships work only if there's significant other compatibility factors and both parties are mature enough to see the opposition as balancing rather than negating. The sex is usually extraordinary because of the elemental tension, which confuses people into thinking the relationship works when it's often just the friction that's compelling.\n\nEarth signs (Ox, Dragon, Goat, Dog) present a complex middle ground. Water controls Earth in destructive cycle (think erosion), but Earth also dams and directs Water. These relationships often manifest as power struggles disguised as stability. You can wear Earth down over time; Earth can block your flow and make you stagnant. With another Dragon, especially an Earth Dragon, there's mutual recognition but potential standoff — two rulers, one throne.\n\nFriendship versus romance distinction matters with you. In friendship, you're more tolerant of Fire and Earth energies because the exposure is limited. You can appreciate Fire friends' enthusiasm in doses. Earth friends provide grounding without the erosion tension of daily intimacy. But romantic relationships are total immersion for you — water doesn't do casual long-term — so element cycle dynamics intensify dramatically.",
  "elementalBalanceGuide": "Your balance isn't about achieving some middle state of mild contentment. Water Dragon balance is about oscillating correctly between depth and expression, withdrawal and engagement, stillness and strike. You're rhythmic by nature; trying to flatten the rhythm into constant availability destroys you.\n\nSigns of excess water (yes, you can have too much of your own element): Paralysis by analysis. You see so many angles that you can't choose one. Emotional flooding where you dump months of accumulated feeling on someone in one conversation. Social withdrawal that crosses from restoration into isolation. Coldness that you intellectualize as boundaries but is actually fear of warmth. Dreams becoming so vivid and consuming that waking life feels less real. Everything feels profound and heavy. You cry at commercials. You're drawn to tragedy. This is water stagnation — too much yin, too much depth with no outlet.\n\nWhen this happens: Force yourself into yang activity. Not Fire energy (you'll resist), but Wood energy. Create something, grow something, teach something. The dragon in you needs an audience sometimes. Give a presentation. Write that analysis. Your water needs to flow downward and outward, not just pool deeper. Physically, you need heat and movement — not aggressive exercise (that's Fire), but sustained walking, swimming (yes, more water, but moving water), tai chi if you're not too proud for the cliché. Reduce salt intake according to your diet, increase warming foods. Spend time with Wood or Fire people who will drain your excess without depleting your essence.\n\nSigns of depleted water: Everything feels effortful and exposed. Your intuition goes quiet — you're making decisions from logic alone and they feel wrong afterward. Fear becomes prominent when normally you're courageous. Your dragon pride compensates by becoming aggressive rather than authoritative. You're rigid when you should be adaptive. Physically: bone-deep exhaustion, lower back issues, hearing sensitivity or tinnitus, salt cravings. You're snapping at people or avoiding them entirely. Your dreams are either absent or anxious rather than deep and symbolic.\n\nWhen this happens: Stop trying to function at full capacity. The dragon will resist admitting weakness — this is ego-death territory for you. Do it anyway. Cancel things. Disappoint people. Your water needs replenishing before it needs directing. Sleep is non-negotiable — water restoration happens during deep sleep cycles. Solitude in natural settings near actual water (ocean, lake, river, even a fountain if you're urban-trapped). Reduce caffeine and stimulants. Increase water intake obviously, but also foods with high water content. This is the season to consume rather than produce, receive rather than give. Read instead of write. Listen instead of speak. Let Metal people help you — their generating energy restores you without demanding anything.\n\nSeasonal awareness is critical for you. Winter is your power season — work with the year's energy rather than against it. Do your deepest work, your most strategic thinking, your most important relationship conversations in winter months. You're more clear, more yourself. Summer is endurance season — maintain rather than expand, protect rather than risk. Spring and autumn are your transition training — practice moving between depth and action more fluidly.\n\nEnvironment adjustments: Your space should have deliberate darkness. Not depression cave darkness, but the darkness of deep water, of contemplation space. Heavy curtains, dimmable lights, nothing harsh. Blue and black tones. Minimize Fire element decor (bright reds, triangular shapes, too much electronics). Water features help if they're substantial — a trickling fountain reads as fake to you. If you can't have real water nearby, images of ocean depths, underwater photography. Your space should feel like a sanctuary from yang world, not an extension of it.\n\nDaily practice: Morning stillness before you engage anything. Even five minutes of sitting without input. Evening review — not productivity analysis, but pattern recognition. What did you observe today? What currents moved beneath surface conversations? Journal this. Your water element feeds on reflection, and the dragon needs to process its observations or they become toxic stagnation. This isn't therapy; this is intelligence analysis on your own life.\n\nYour element cycle leverage: When you need to create or nurture, activate Wood energy (start projects, mentor someone). When you need to recover or resource, seek Metal energy (structure, refinement, solo craftsmanship). When you need to control or cool a situation, remember Fire fears you—your calm is power, not weakness."
