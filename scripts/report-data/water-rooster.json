  "elementalIdentity": "You are the Water Rooster, and you see what others miss. While the world drowns in noise, you're tuned to the frequency beneath — the unspoken tension in a room, the flaw in someone's reasoning, the opportunity everyone else walked past. This isn't mere observation; it's perception sharpened to a surgical edge. Water gives you depth and adaptability that other Roosters lack. Where Metal Roosters cut with precision and Wood Roosters crusade with conviction, you flow around obstacles while cataloging every detail. You're the Rooster who watches, waits, and then speaks with devastating accuracy.\n\nThe Rooster alone is already analytical, precise, structured — a creature of dawn who announces truth whether people want to hear it or not. Add Water, and you gain something the other Roosters don't have: emotional intelligence and strategic patience. You're not just pointing out what's wrong; you understand WHY it's wrong and who will resist fixing it. You read people the way others read books. This makes you formidable in any situation requiring both intellectual clarity and social navigation. You can be the whistleblower who actually gets heard, the consultant who transforms organizations, the friend who tells hard truths without burning bridges.\n\nBut here's the shadow: Water Roosters often become paralyzed by what they perceive. You see too much. You notice the hairline fractures in every plan, the hidden motives in every smile, the inevitable failure lurking in every beginning. This can make you cynical, withholding, or perpetually dissatisfied. You might spend so much time analyzing that you forget to act. Or worse, you act with such calculated precision that you lose spontaneity, warmth, connection. People sometimes experience you as cold or manipulative, even when you think you're being helpful. You're showing them reality; they're feeling judged.\n\nThe Perceptive Observer archetype means you're built to witness and interpret, not necessarily to lead or perform. You're at your best in roles where insight matters more than charisma — the investigator, the editor, the strategist, the therapist who sees patterns clients can't. You excel when you can observe systems over time, accumulate knowledge, and then intervene with precision. You struggle when forced into constant visibility or when pressured to make quick decisions without sufficient data. Unlike Fire Roosters who thrive on immediate feedback, you need time to let information settle, to watch how the currents move beneath the surface.\n\nThis combination of Water and Rooster creates someone who is both exacting and flexible, critical and understanding, sharp-tongued and emotionally attuned. You're the paradox of the perfectionist who knows perfection is impossible but pursues it anyway. The idealist who sees through every illusion but still believes things could be better. The loner who understands human nature better than most people understand themselves. Your challenge isn't becoming more perceptive — you're already there. It's learning when to stop observing and start trusting, when to speak and when to let the current carry you, when your wisdom helps and when it just makes everyone uncomfortable, including you.",
  "elementInDepth": "Water in you operates as both gift and burden. In the Wu Xing cycle, Water generates Wood and controls Fire — this means your natural energy feeds growth and creativity while simultaneously checking excess passion and chaos. As a Water Rooster, you instinctively nurture potential in others (Wood) while dampening drama and recklessness (Fire). You're the person who sees someone's raw talent and knows exactly how to cultivate it, and you're also the person who spots dangerous enthusiasm and throws cold water on it before disaster strikes. Both make you invaluable. Both make you occasionally resented.\n\nWhen your Water element is strong and clear, you're in flow state. You adapt without losing yourself. You observe without drowning in information overload. Your mind moves like a stream — fluid, persistent, finding its way around obstacles rather than crashing against them. Strong Water gives you wisdom beyond your years, the ability to read between lines, strategic patience that lets you wait for the perfect moment. You become the person others seek out for advice because you see what they cannot, and you deliver truth with enough compassion that they can actually hear it. Your communication has weight without rigidity.\n\nBut Water can also become stagnant or flooding. Stagnant Water happens when you isolate, overthink, or get trapped in cycles of analysis without action. You know that feeling — endlessly reviewing options, seeing all possible outcomes, paralyzed by your own clarity about how things could go wrong. Stagnant Water Roosters become bitter critics who've observed so much failure they've stopped believing in success. You're no longer flowing; you're a cold pool that nothing grows in. People stop coming to you because your insights have curdled into cynicism.\n\nFlooding Water is the opposite problem — emotional overwhelm disguised as intellectual activity. This happens when you absorb too much from your environment, when your perceptive nature picks up every ambient anxiety and unexpressed conflict around you. Flooding Water Roosters appear in control but are internally drowning. You might throw yourself into excessive information consumption, obsessive planning, or controlling behaviors that feel like wisdom but are actually fear. Your gift of perception becomes a curse when you can't turn it off, when you're picking up frequencies you were never meant to carry.\n\nMetal feeds Water in the productive cycle, which means you draw energy from precision, boundaries, and structure. When life feels chaotic, Metal activities restore you — organizing your space, refining a skill, setting clear standards, saying no. You're not a Metal sign, but you need Metal's edges to contain your flowing nature. Without it, you become diffuse, absorbing everyone's problems, losing definition. Earth, however, controls Water. Too much Earth energy — over-stabilization, excessive routine, emotional suppression in the name of practicality — will dam you up. You need movement to stay healthy.\n\nYour relationship with Fire is especially important. Fire controls Metal in the cycle, and you control Fire. This means you're naturally positioned to check the very element that threatens your resources. When Fire years or Fire people enter your life, you feel the tension immediately. Fire wants to burn bright and fast; you want to observe and consider. Fire creates urgency; you create patience. This dynamic can be either complementary or combative. At its best, Fire gives you the urgency to act on your perceptions. At its worst, it feels like pressure to move before you're ready, and you respond by becoming more withdrawn or critical.\n\nThe Water Rooster's elemental challenge is staying fluid without losing discernment, staying perceptive without becoming overwhelmed, staying honest without becoming harsh. You need to honor both parts of your nature — the Water that connects and adapts, the Rooster that analyzes and perfects. When these work together, you're unstoppable. When they fight, Water makes you doubt your judgments and Rooster makes you rigid in your flow.",
  "yearAhead2026": "The Year of the Fire Horse arrives, and for you, Water Rooster, it's going to feel like someone turned up the temperature and the tempo simultaneously. Fire Horse years are notorious for intensity, speed, impulsiveness, and dramatic change. Everything you're not naturally inclined toward. While others might find this energy exhilarating, you're more likely to experience it as overwhelming, chaotic, or forced. But here's what most analyses won't tell you: this year is exactly what you need, even if it doesn't feel that way.\n\nFire and Water are in direct elemental conflict — Water controls Fire. This means the year's dominant energy is something you're built to check, manage, and temper. On one level, this positions you as a stabilizing force. While everyone around you is making impulsive decisions and chasing shiny distractions, you'll see through the hype and spot the actual opportunities. Your perceptive nature will be in high demand, especially in Q2 and Q3 when Fire Horse energy peaks. People will need your cold water wisdom to avoid burning themselves out or burning bridges they'll regret.\n\nBut here's the trap: you might overcorrect. You might become the person who says no to everything, who sees only risk, who uses your wisdom as a shield against necessary growth. Fire Horse years demand action, movement, courage — all things that don't come naturally when you're busy observing and analyzing. The challenge isn't to resist the year's energy but to let it heat you up just enough. Think of it as tempering metal: the fire doesn't destroy, it strengthens. You need to let some of this wild Fire energy burn away your excess caution.\n\nQ1 (January-March 2026) starts relatively manageable. Fire Horse hasn't fully galloped yet, and you'll feel some breathing room to assess, plan, and prepare. Use this quarter to shore up your boundaries and clarify your intentions. What do you actually want this year, beyond merely avoiding chaos? The Horse energy will move fast once it starts; you need to know your direction before the acceleration begins. This is also when you'll need to resist the temptation to isolate or pre-emptively withdraw. Stay engaged.\n\nQ2 (April-June) brings the heat. Fire Horse energy surges, and you'll feel the pressure to make quick decisions, to be more visible than comfortable, to trust your instincts rather than waiting for complete information. This is your growth edge. Say yes to something that scares you slightly. Take action before you feel fully ready. The world will reward speed over perfection this quarter, which goes against your Rooster nature, but there's wisdom in adapting. Watch for opportunities in communication, teaching, or public-facing work — your perceptive insights will cut through the noise if you're willing to share them.\n\nQ3 (July-September) is peak intensity but also peak opportunity. This is when Fire Horse years deliver their biggest breakthroughs and biggest burnouts, often simultaneously. For you, this quarter requires balance: engage with the momentum without getting swept away. You'll likely be dealing with someone else's drama or crisis — your ability to stay clear-headed when everyone else is reactive makes you invaluable. Don't martyr yourself, though. You can help without absorbing. This is also the quarter where relationship tensions surface; Fire accelerates whatever was simmering beneath. Use your perceptive skills to address issues directly rather than letting them flood.\n\nQ4 (October-December) brings relief as the year winds down. Fire Horse energy starts to settle, and you'll finally have space to process everything that happened. This is your integration quarter — take what worked, discard what didn't, and prepare for the calmer energies ahead. You might feel exhausted, and that's legitimate. Water needs time to replenish. But you'll also likely feel proud of how you navigated chaos without losing yourself. The key insight for this quarter: what you learned about acting before you feel ready is more valuable than any mistake you made along the way.\n\nThe core message for 2026: let Fire refine you, not define you. This year will push you out of pure observation mode and into engaged participation. That's uncomfortable but necessary. You've been watching long enough. Time to move with the current, even when it runs faster than you prefer.",
  "compatibilityMap": "The Water Rooster approach to relationship is paradoxical: you're intensely observant about others while being surprisingly opaque about yourself. You see people with X-ray clarity — their wounds, patterns, potential, and lies. But revealing your own depths? That requires trust you don't give easily. You're drawn to people who either match your perceptive intensity or provide something you lack. The former become your intellectual equals; the latter become your teachers in embodiment, spontaneity, or emotional directness.\n\nElementally, you're most compatible with Metal and Wood signs. Metal signs (Monkey, Rooster, Dog in Metal years) feed your Water nature in the productive cycle. They provide the structure and boundaries you need to feel safe enough to flow. Metal partners understand your need for precision and won't be offended by your critical eye — they have one too. Together you build something refined, functional, and enduring. The risk is coldness: two analytical minds can create a relationship that works perfectly on paper but lacks warmth. You need to consciously cultivate softness with Metal partners. The sex can be surprisingly intense, though — all that controlled energy needs somewhere to go.\n\nWood signs (Tiger, Rabbit in Wood years) are fed by your Water element. You naturally nurture Wood's growth, and Wood gives you purpose beyond mere observation. These relationships feel meaningful because you're actively helping someone flourish. Wood partners bring warmth, idealism, and forward motion that balance your cautious, observant nature. The challenge is exhaustion: if Wood is too demanding or entitled, you'll feel drained by constant giving. You need Wood partners who appreciate your contributions rather than taking them for granted. In romance, these pairings have natural chemistry — you soften their rough edges, they inspire you to take action.\n\nEarth signs (Ox, Dragon, Sheep, Dog in Earth years) create tension because Earth controls Water in the destructive cycle. Earth partners will feel grounding at first but can become suffocating. They want to stabilize you, contain you, make you more practical and less fluid. You'll feel compressed, unable to flow freely. These relationships work only if Earth understands they cannot dam you up, and you understand they're not trying to diminish you — they're trying to give you form. Friendship with Earth signs is easier than romance; the stakes are lower, so the control dynamics don't chafe as much.\n\nFire signs (Snake, Horse in Fire years) are the ones you control elementally, and this creates complicated dynamics. You're attracted to Fire's intensity, passion, and decisiveness — everything you're not. Fire seems free in ways you envy. But you also see Fire's recklessness and can't help but try to temper it. Fire experiences this as criticism or coldness. You experience their resistance as immaturity. These relationships often become parent-child dynamics where you're the responsible one managing Fire's chaos. Hot sex, frequent fights, eventual burnout. If you're both mature, Fire can teach you spontaneity while you teach Fire wisdom. But that requires Fire wanting to learn, which isn't guaranteed.\n\nWater signs (Rat, Pig in Water years) are your elemental kin, and these relationships feel like looking in a mirror — comfortable but not always growth-inducing. You understand each other's need for depth, reflection, and emotional complexity. The problem is too much similarity: who makes decisions when you both want to observe first? Who provides certainty when you're both swimming in possibility? Water-Water pairings work best when one person has stronger secondary elements that create differentiation. Otherwise you risk creating a stagnant pool where nothing grows.\n\nIn friendship, you're loyal but selective. You'd rather have three deep friendships than thirty shallow ones. You're the friend who remembers everything, notices when something's off, and tells truths others avoid. People appreciate this until they don't — until your perceptiveness feels invasive or your honesty feels harsh. You need friends who can handle your directness and who bring qualities you lack: spontaneity, optimism, or emotional courage. You're not a casual hang-out person; you want depth or you want solitude.\n\nIn romance, you're intensely devoted but emotionally guarded. You show love through insight and service — understanding your partner deeply, solving their problems, seeing their potential. You're less comfortable with grand gestures or vulnerable declarations. This can leave partners feeling uncertain about your feelings even as you're demonstrating them constantly through action. You need partners who understand that your way of loving is different but real, and you need to learn that sometimes people need to hear what you're showing them.",
  "elementalBalanceGuide": "Balancing Water element as a Rooster means honoring both flow and structure, depth and discernment, intuition and analysis. You're not purely Water — you're Water shaped by Rooster precision. This means you need both movement and boundaries, both feeling and thinking, both connection and solitude. When one dominates, you suffer.\n\nExcess Water shows up as overthinking disguised as wisdom. You're lost in analysis, seeing all sides of every situation, unable to commit to a direction. You're absorbing everyone's emotions like a psychic sponge, taking on problems that aren't yours to solve. You might be sleeping too much, escaping into substances or media consumption, or avoiding conflict by going with whatever flow requires least resistance. Excess Water makes you shapeless — agreeable on the surface, secretly resentful underneath. Your Rooster precision becomes useless when Water overwhelms it; you can't organize chaos, you can only drown in it.\n\nDeficient Water appears as rigidity, brittleness, or emotional drought. You're all Rooster criticism with none of Water's compassion. You've forgotten how to adapt, how to read the room, how to let things flow. You're pushing when you should be yielding, judging when you should be understanding, controlling when you should be trusting. Deficient Water turns you into the worst version of Rooster — harsh, perfectionist, isolated by your own standards. You've lost access to wisdom that comes from feeling, not just thinking.\n\nTo balance excess Water, you need Metal and Fire practices. Metal gives you boundaries and definition. This looks like: clear daily structure, defined work hours, physical practices that require precision (martial arts, yoga, playing an instrument), decluttering your space, saying no without guilt, spending time alone to discharge absorbed emotions rather than staying in crowd energy. You need edges. Get them through discipline, not force.\n\nFire helps by creating urgency and action. When you're stuck in watery overthinking, do something that requires immediate response: competitive sports, public speaking, teaching, dancing, anything with an audience or time pressure. Fire burns off excess Water through evaporation — you stop drowning in possibility when you commit to one actual thing. Small fires work best: don't try to become someone you're not, just add heat to specific areas. Ten minutes of intense movement can shift stuck Water more than hours of contemplation.\n\nTo balance deficient Water, you need Wood and more Water practices. Wood helps by giving you something to nurture besides your own perfectionism. This looks like: gardening, mentoring, creative projects, helping others grow without controlling how they grow. Wood reminds you that life is messy and still beautiful, that growth happens through chaos, not just through optimization.\n\nMore Water comes through: spending time near actual water (ocean, rivers, baths), practicing receptivity instead of constant output, listening more and talking less, engaging with art or music that makes you feel rather than think, allowing yourself to be uncertain or confused without immediately solving it. Journal without editing yourself. Sit with emotions instead of analyzing them. Let information come to you rather than aggressively seeking it.\n\nSeasonally, you're strongest in Winter (Water season) and challenged by Summer (Fire season). Winter is when you should do your deepest work — reflection, planning, strategic thinking. You have natural advantage when others are depleted. Summer requires adaptation: you need to warm yourself up, be more visible and active than comfortable, engage with Fire energy instead of resisting it. Spring (Wood season) and Autumn (Metal season) are your support seasons — Spring lets you nurture growth, Autumn lets you refine and organize.\n\nDaily practices that keep you balanced: morning pages or journaling (discharges excess observation), cold showers (reminds Water it can be invigorating not just overwhelming), walking near water, limiting news and social media intake (your perceptive nature picks up too much anxiety from these sources), creative work that requires both precision and flow (writing, music, design), and most importantly — regular check-ins with yourself about whether you're observing life or living it. The moment you catch yourself spending more time analyzing than experiencing, you know you're out of balance.\n\nYour elemental work isn't to become less Water or less Rooster. It's to let these qualities dance instead of fight, to flow with precision and analyze with compassion, to observe deeply while participating fully. The balanced Water Rooster is the wisest person in the room who's also present enough to laugh at the joke, perceptive enough to see the problem and grounded enough to help solve it, clear-eyed about reality and still hopeful about what's possible. That's who you're becoming."
