  "elementalIdentity": "You are the Metal Snake — precision incarnate, wrapped in serpentine stillness. Where other snakes hypnotize through mystery, you cut through fog with crystalline clarity. Your metal element doesn't soften the snake's enigmatic nature; it sharpens it into something surgical. You are the blade that waits, the strategist who sees seventeen moves ahead while others are still processing move three. This isn't the warm, nurturing metal of a protective shield — this is the cold, uncompromising metal of a scalpel. You don't just observe; you dissect. The Calculating Blade archetype fits because you combine the snake's patient, coiled intelligence with metal's unrelenting standards. You're not cruel, but you are exacting. You notice what others miss: the micro-expression that reveals deception, the pattern that predicts collapse, the weakness in an argument that everyone else accepted without question. Metal gives you structure where typical snakes might drift into abstraction. You don't just philosophize about truth — you demand evidence. You don't just sense deception — you can articulate exactly how someone is lying and why. Among the sixty signs, you occupy a unique territory: the thinker who acts, the strategist who strikes. Fire Snake burns with passion but lacks your restraint. Water Snake flows but lacks your spine. Earth Snake stabilizes but lacks your edge. Wood Snake grows but lacks your pruning wisdom. You alone combine the snake's penetrating insight with metal's capacity for decisive action. Your danger lies in becoming too sharp, too cutting. Metal Snake can wound without meaning to, can hold standards so high that even you can't meet them. The snake's natural tendency toward isolation intensifies under metal's influence — you can refine yourself into complete solitude, perfecting your thoughts in an echo chamber of one. But when balanced, you are formidable: the advisor who tells hard truths, the artist who creates with technical mastery, the friend who sees through masks but loves the real person underneath. You don't deal in comforting lies. Your gift is clear-eyed assessment delivered with enough compassion to be useful rather than destructive.",
  "elementInDepth": "Metal in its pure form represents contraction, condensation, concentration. It's the element of autumn when life essence withdraws inward, when nature strips away excess and reveals essential structure. In you, this manifests as an almost painful clarity — you cannot tolerate vagueness, cannot function in spaces where definitions shift and boundaries blur. Your metal element demands precision in language, in thought, in action. This can make you an exceptional editor, analyst, or diagnostician. You see what needs cutting away. But metal's nature is also grief, letting go, release. There's a melancholy that runs through Metal Snake like a silver thread. You understand impermanence not philosophically but viscerally. You feel the weight of what cannot last, cannot be held, cannot be perfected despite your best efforts. In the generative cycle, your metal produces water — meaning when you're functioning well, your precision and clarity naturally flow into wisdom and depth. Your sharp analyses eventually pool into understanding. You generate insight not through accumulation but through distillation. This is why people seek your counsel: you don't add to their confusion, you reduce it to essence. You control wood in the destructive cycle, which manifests as your ability to prune overgrowth, to cut back expansive ideas to viable plans, to say 'no' when others are swept up in enthusiasm. This makes you invaluable in situations requiring discernment, but it can also make you the person who kills the mood, who points out flaws in the dream. When your metal is strong — when you're well-resourced, rested, mentally clear — you are brilliant. Your judgments are sound. Your words land with precision. Your standards elevate everyone around you. But when metal becomes excessive, you turn brittle. You become hypercritical, finding fault in everything including yourself. Your clarity becomes cutting coldness. Your standards become impossible perfectionism. You wound with words you don't realize are weapons. When metal is depleted — when you're exhausted, scattered, or emotionally overwhelmed — you lose your edge entirely. You become indecisive, unable to access the discernment that usually defines you. You might grasp at rules and systems to compensate, becoming rigidly dogmatic rather than genuinely precise. Fire controls your metal, which means excessive passion, drama, or chaos literally melts your structure. You can't think straight in environments of constant crisis. Earth generates your metal, so grounding practices, stable routines, and dependable relationships strengthen your fundamental nature. You need solid ground to sharpen against.",
  "yearAhead2026": "The Fire Horse arrives in 2026 like a wildfire racing across dry grassland — and you, Metal Snake, will feel this as direct opposition. Fire controls metal. This isn't subtle. The Horse's galloping momentum contradicts your coiled patience. The Horse's loud enthusiasm clashes with your quiet precision. This year will test whether your metal has been properly tempered or whether it will melt under pressure. The central theme: You cannot out-wait this year. Your usual strategy of observation and delayed strike won't serve you. Fire Horse demands visible action, forward movement, decisive engagement. This will feel uncomfortable. Lean into it anyway. Q1 (February-April) begins with intensity. The Fire Horse year starts strong and expects you to match its energy. This quarter is about establishing which battles you'll fight and which you'll genuinely release. Your tendency will be to critique the Horse's recklessness, to see chaos where others see excitement. Resist pure cynicism. Instead, identify one area where you can move faster than usual — launch the project, have the conversation, make the cut you've been delaying. Let fire's heat forge you into a stronger blade rather than melting your resolve. Watch for conflicts with authority figures or partners who want immediate decisions you're not ready to make. Q2 (May-July) brings resource questions. Fire consumes, and you'll feel the drain on your energy reserves, your finances, or your attention. This is when Metal Snakes typically retreat to conserve strength. Don't fully withdraw. The opportunity here is in collaboration — Fire Horse years favor partnerships, particularly with people whose enthusiasm balances your analysis. Seek out the Wood or Fire sign person whose vision needs your strategic clarity. Your role this quarter is translator: turning wild ideas into viable plans. Romance and creative projects both heat up, but watch for burnout. Q3 (August-October) is your power season. Autumn metal strengthens your fundamental nature even during a Fire year. This is when you can finally operate from your deepest wisdom. The Horse energy will still push for speed, but now you can harness it rather than being overwhelmed. This quarter is ideal for completing projects, having difficult conversations you've been avoiding, and making cuts that needed to happen. Your judgment is clearest now. Use it. This is also when you'll see which risks you took in Q1 and Q2 are paying off. Q4 (November-January) requires surrender. The year ends with you needing to accept what you cannot control or perfect. Fire Horse energy doesn't resolve neatly. There will be loose ends. Let them exist. Your growth this year isn't in achieving flawlessness but in learning to function powerfully amid imperfection. End the year by identifying what you're releasing — the standard you can't meet, the person you can't fix, the outcome you can't force. This isn't defeat; it's metal's true wisdom expressing through letting go.",
  "compatibilityMap": "You need earth element people in your intimate circle. Not want — need. Earth generates metal, meaning Ox, Dragon, Dog, and Goat signs provide the stability against which you can sharpen yourself. With Earth signs, you feel simultaneously grounded and elevated. They don't ask you to be warmer or softer; they appreciate your precision as valuable rather than harsh. In romance, Earth Snake or Earth Ox offers profound compatibility — the relationship feels like coming home to yourself but better. These are the people who give you the stillness you need to think clearly, who build structures that support rather than constrain your nature. Friendship with Earth signs is where you do your best thinking; romance with them is where you feel safest being completely honest. Water element people draw out your depths. Water signs (Rat, Pig) receive your metal's production in the generative cycle, meaning your clarity flows naturally into their emotional wisdom. With Water Rat especially, there's an intellectual-emotional alchemy: your analysis becomes their intuition's raw material. These relationships teach you that precision and feeling aren't opposites. In romance, Water signs can feel too fluid for your taste — you want definition, they want flow — but when it works, they soften your edges without dulling your blade. Friendships with Water signs tend to be more sustainable than romances; you can be their strategist without the vulnerability romance demands. Fire element people (Tiger, Horse, Snake) challenge you directly. Fire controls metal, remember. These relationships feel exciting and destabilizing in equal measure. Fire signs push you out of your coiled waiting, force you into action before you feel ready, and generally disrespect your need for careful timing. In romance, Fire signs can bring passion you didn't know you needed — or drama you definitely didn't. The sex is intense; the arguments are exhausting. These relationships work only when you're secure enough to let them forge you rather than melt you. Friendship with Fire signs is easier because there's distance built in. They become the people who drag you to the party you end up enjoying despite yourself. Wood element people (Tiger, Rabbit) trigger your controlling impulse. You cut wood in the destructive cycle, meaning you naturally see where they need pruning. With Wood Rabbit especially, you might find yourself constantly correcting, editing, redirecting. In romance, this dynamic becomes toxic fast — you become the critic, they become the disappointing project. But when Wood signs are mature and you're conscious of your tendency to control, these relationships can be productive. They grow; you guide. Just watch for the pattern where you're always the editor and never the enthusiast. Friendships work better when there's a shared project where your roles are clear. Metal element people (Monkey, Rooster) are your mirrors. With Metal Rooster, you recognize a kindred precision. These relationships are intellectually stimulating but can become cold — two blades sharpening each other to the point where there's no softness left. You understand each other perfectly, which sounds ideal until you realize you're enabling each other's worst tendencies toward criticism and perfectionism. In romance, you need a third element involved — a shared Earth friend, a Water therapist — to prevent the relationship from becoming an echo chamber of judgment. Friendships with Metal signs work well in professional contexts where your combined discernment serves a clear purpose.",
  "elementalBalanceGuide": "You know your metal is excessive when criticism becomes your default mode. When you notice flaws before beauty, problems before potential, what's wrong before what's working — your metal has overgrown its purpose. Physical signs: jaw tension, shoulder tightness, shallow breathing high in the chest. Your body literally hardens when metal is too strong. You become brittle in conversation, snapping at small provocations. Your standards become weapons you use against yourself and others. To reduce excess metal, you need practices that introduce flow and warmth. Not permanent personality changes — temporary counterbalances. Spend time near water. Actual water. Rivers, lakes, oceans. Let your precise thoughts dissolve into the sound of waves. Water doesn't have edges; it reminds you that boundaries can be softer than you make them. Introduce fire carefully: candlelight, warm baths, spicy foods. Not chaos, but controlled warmth that gently heats your metal without overwhelming it. Practice finishing sentences without qualifications, corrections, or improvements. Just let statements stand incomplete. You know your metal is deficient when you can't make decisions, when you grasp at rules to compensate for lost discernment, when you feel scattered and unfocused. Your thoughts lack their usual precision. You might become uncharacteristically rigid, clinging to systems because your internal clarity has failed. Physical signs: fatigue, mental fog, difficulty concentrating, feeling ungrounded. To strengthen depleted metal, return to earth. Literally. Garden, touch soil, walk barefoot on grass. Cook with root vegetables. Establish routines — not as prisons but as structures that support your nature. Morning practices work best: make your bed with precision, prepare tea with attention to detail, organize one small space completely. These aren't chores; they're metal-strengthening rituals. Work with your hands: pottery, woodworking, knife sharpening, calligraphy. Activities that produce clean edges and finished objects rebuild your sense of clarity. Seasonal awareness is crucial. Autumn is your power season. From late August through October, your metal naturally strengthens. Use this time for your most important decisions, your hardest conversations, your major cuts and releases. Don't waste autumn on maintenance; use it for transformation. Spring weakens you — Wood's expansive growth energy directly opposes metal's contractive clarity. During spring, be gentle with yourself. Your standards can relax slightly. This is when you need earth element friends most. Summer's fire can melt your structure, so summer requires conscious boundary-setting. Limit commitments, maintain routines even when others are loose and spontaneous, protect your sleep. Winter's water receives your production, so winter is when your analysis becomes wisdom. This is teaching season for you, when your insights are most accessible to others. Environmental adjustments matter more than you'd think. Your physical space should have clean lines, uncluttered surfaces, quality over quantity. But avoid sterility — the all-white, minimalist extreme is metal excess manifesting in space. Introduce earth tones: terracotta, warm browns, clay. Metal objects are good: bells, singing bowls, quality knives properly stored. But balance them with wooden cutting boards, stone vessels, elements that generate and receive your nature. Your daily practice: One moment of allowing imperfection. Just one. The typo you don't correct. The observation you don't voice. The standard you consciously choose not to apply. This isn't lowering your metal's value — it's preventing it from cutting through everything including your peace. You are precise because you care about truth, not because you need to prove your worth through constant criticism. Remember that, and your blade stays sharp without drawing blood."
