  "elementalIdentity": "You are the Fire Rooster, and you don't do anything halfway. Your element is the flame that illuminates and purifies, and your animal is the barnyard perfectionist who notices every misplaced feather. This combination creates something rare: a visionary with an eye for detail, a revolutionary who insists on proper execution. While Water Roosters analyze through caution and Metal Roosters refine through criticism, you blaze through life with passionate certainty about how things should be done. You're not just pointing out flaws—you're burning away impurities in pursuit of a vision you can see with crystalline clarity.\n\nFire naturally rises, spreads, and transforms whatever it touches. In you, this manifests as an inability to keep your opinions, your presence, or your standards contained. The Rooster already possesses sharp observation and vocal honesty; fire amplifies this into prophetic intensity. You don't just see what's wrong—you feel compelled to announce it, fix it, set it ablaze if necessary. Your archetype as the Bold Perfectionist means you combine the courage to act with the precision to act correctly. You're the reformer who actually shows up with a plan, the critic who can back up every word with demonstrated excellence.\n\nWhat makes you distinct among the sixty signs is this marriage of heat and precision. Fire signs typically scatter their energy broadly—Fire Horse runs wild, Fire Dragon explodes in all directions. But Rooster nature provides the structure, the schedule, the meticulous attention that channels your flames into a focused torch rather than a wildfire. You burn hot, but you burn with purpose. You don't just want to tear down the old; you want to rebuild it correctly, and you have very specific ideas about what 'correctly' means.\n\nYour shadow side is equally specific: you can become the tyrant of taste, the perfectionist who burns out their own people with impossible standards. When your fire runs too hot, your Rooster tendency toward criticism becomes scorched-earth policy. You don't just point out the flaw; you incinerate the person who made it. Your passion for excellence can curdle into rigid dogmatism, where your way isn't just better—it's the only way that doesn't deserve to be reduced to ash. You risk becoming so identified with your vision that anyone who questions it becomes an enemy rather than a collaborator.\n\nBut at your best, you're the leader who inspires through demonstrated mastery. You don't ask others to do what you won't do yourself, and you do it with flair. Your fire element gives you the charisma that pure Earth or Metal Roosters lack—people don't just respect your competence, they're drawn to your intensity, your certainty, your refusal to compromise on what matters. You make excellence look urgent and necessary, not just nice to have. You're the rooster who doesn't just crow at dawn—you set the sky on fire with your announcement that a new day has arrived, and it's going to be done right.",
  "elementInDepth": "Fire in Chinese elemental logic is the height of Yang expression—maximum light, maximum heat, maximum expansion. It's the element of summer, when everything visible reaches its peak growth and expression. In you, Fire doesn't just warm; it illuminates. Your Rooster nature gives you natural discernment, the ability to separate wheat from chaff. Fire supercharges this into x-ray vision for mediocrity, pretense, and half-measures. You don't just notice the details; you see through to essential truth with burning clarity. This makes you exceptional at cutting through noise and identifying what actually matters.\n\nThe productive cycle tells us that Fire generates Earth. In practical terms, your passionate intensity creates tangible results—your visions become systems, your criticisms become improvements, your standards create foundations others build upon. When you burn brightly and constructively, you leave behind something solid: reformed institutions, elevated standards, trained successors who carry your torch. Your fire isn't just destructive; it's transformative in ways that endure. You turn enthusiasm into expertise, inspiration into infrastructure.\n\nFire controls Metal in the controlling cycle, and this is where your elemental advantage becomes tactical. Metal represents structure, rules, refinement, cutting away excess. For most signs, Metal's sharp edges and rigid frameworks pose challenges. But your Fire melts Metal, reshapes it, determines its form. This means you're unusually effective at reforming systems, challenging established hierarchies, and bending rules toward better outcomes. You don't just follow the structure—you heat it until it's malleable enough to improve. Rooster's natural Metal affinity means you respect good systems even as your Fire insists on perfecting them.\n\nBut here's what you must understand: Fire is also controlled by Water. When you encounter Water-heavy people, situations, or seasons, your flames can be doused. Water's formlessness, its emotional depth, its preference for going around rather than through—these qualities can frustrate you into sputtering rage or depressive dampening. You need to recognize when you're being controlled so you don't waste energy fighting tides. Sometimes the strategic move is to bank your fires temporarily, not to extinguish them but to preserve them until conditions favor burning again.\n\nWhen your Fire runs strong, you're unstoppable: confident, charismatic, productive, inspiring. You wake up knowing exactly what needs to happen and possessing the energy to make it happen. Your standards elevate everyone around you. Your passion is contagious. Your vision pulls people toward a better version of what could be. Strong Fire gives you the courage to speak unpopular truths and the magnetism to make people listen anyway.\n\nWhen Fire depletes—through exhaustion, through lack of fuel, through Water dousing—you become brittle, reactive, and mean. Depleted Fire in a Rooster manifests as petty tyranny: criticizing without vision, demanding perfection without inspiration, burning bridges instead of lighting paths. You know you're running on empty when your feedback stops building and starts destroying, when you're tearing down more than you're creating, when your standards serve your ego rather than any genuine vision of improvement. Depleted Fire makes you the rooster pecking at everyone's ankles without remembering why excellence matters in the first place. Watch for the signs: chronic irritability, inability to delegate, criticism that lands as cruelty rather than clarity. These tell you that your fire needs feeding, not fanning—you need fuel, not just more air to burn through.",
  "yearAhead2026": "2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse, and this is a year that will either ignite you or exhaust you—possibly both. Horse years are kinetic, expansive, and unpredictable; Fire Horse years double down on that volatility. For you as a Fire Rooster, this year brings someone who shares your element but operates with completely different logic. Where you channel fire through precision and standards, Horse scatters it through movement and freedom. This creates friction but also possibility. The key is recognizing that Horse energy will not conform to your systems, so you must learn to work with momentum rather than against chaos.\n\nThe Fire Horse year favors bold moves, public visibility, and rapid transformation. Your natural inclination toward preparation and perfection will be tested by a year that rewards those who leap before the landing is fully visible. This doesn't mean abandon your standards—it means accelerate your timeline. What you thought needed another six months of refinement? Launch it in three. The opportunities this year won't wait for your perfectionism. Fire Horse asks: Is it good enough to matter right now? If yes, move.\n\nQ1 (Winter into Spring) starts strong for you. The transition from Wood Snake into Fire Horse energy gives you a brief window where your preparation meets accelerating momentum. This is your best quarter for launching projects, making bold career moves, or taking a public stand on something that matters. The Horse hasn't hit full gallop yet, so you can still shape the narrative and set standards. But move fast—by late March, the pace picks up beyond anyone's control.\n\nQ2 (Spring into Summer) is where Fire Horse hits stride and you might feel trampled if you're trying to maintain control. This quarter demands flexibility you don't naturally possess. The harder you grip, the more you'll strain. Your challenge is to identify what absolutely must meet your standards versus what can be good enough. Delegate without your usual detailed oversight. Let some things be messy if they're moving in the right direction. Your wins this quarter come from strategic release, not tighter control. Watch for opportunities in fast-moving industries, social movements, or collaborative projects where your vision can guide without you micromanaging every detail.\n\nQ3 (Summer into Fall) brings potential burnout if you haven't paced yourself. Double Fire energy—yours and the year's—can overheat. You'll be tempted to push harder, speak louder, demand more, but this is actually when you need to bank some flames. Use this quarter for consolidation rather than expansion. Review what you launched in Q1 and Q2; identify what's working and what's burning resources without return. This is also when relationships may fray if you've been too intense. Make deliberate time for relationships that operate on warmth rather than heat—people who can sit with you in comfortable silence rather than constant doing.\n\nQ4 (Fall into Winter) offers recovery and strategic positioning for 2027's Earth Goat year. As Fire Horse winds down, you get to demonstrate what your standards were building toward all along. This is your quarter to showcase results, claim credit appropriately, and begin transitioning toward the more grounded, systematic energy that Earth Goat will favor. Document your wins. Formalize what worked. Build frameworks from this year's momentum so you're not starting from scratch when the energy shifts. The Fire Horse year will teach you something crucial about balancing vision with velocity—make sure you extract those lessons before the year closes.\n\nYour biggest warning: Don't let Horse energy seduce you into scatter. You're not a Horse, and you shouldn't try to be. Your power remains in focused intensity, not frantic motion. Partner with people who have Horse energy rather than competing with them. Let them handle breadth while you ensure depth and quality. This year rewards your boldness but punishes your brittleness—stay hot but stay supple.",
  "compatibilityMap": "Your relationship dynamics are shaped by fire's need for fuel and air, and by Rooster's need for respect and competence. You don't love easily or casually—you ignite for people who can match your intensity and meet your standards. This makes you selective in ways that can look cold but actually protects your considerable passion for the rare individuals who prove worthy of it. Understanding elemental compatibility helps you recognize who can feed your flames versus who will exhaust or douse them.\n\nBest elemental matches for Fire Rooster: Wood and Earth signs offer what you need most. Wood feeds Fire—these are people who fuel your vision, support your intensity, and grow alongside your heat without combusting. Wood signs (Tigers, Rabbits, Dragons in Wood years) bring flexibility you lack and creativity that inspires rather than threatens. They admire your standards without feeling diminished by them. Wood partners challenge you through growth rather than opposition. In romance, Wood signs can soften your edges without dulling your blade; they remind you that perfection includes room for organic development. In friendship, Wood people are your collaborators and champions, the ones who say 'yes, and' to your vision rather than 'yes, but.'\n\nEarth signs (Oxen, Dragons, Goats, Dogs in Earth years) receive what you generate. Fire produces Earth—your intensity creates stability through them. Earth partners give your passion a place to land, your criticism a purpose to serve. They're impressed by your excellence and willing to build systems around your insights. The danger is that you can take Earth's groundedness for granted, burning too hot and drying them into desert. But healthy Fire-Earth pairings are extraordinarily productive: you inspire, they implement; you envision, they construct; you blaze trails, they build roads. In romance, Earth signs provide the stability your intensity needs to avoid burnout. They're the cool hand on your fevered brow, the reminder that not everything needs to happen right now.\n\nFire-Fire relationships (other Fire Roosters, Fire Horses, Fire Snakes) are explosive—sometimes spectacular, sometimes destructive. Two fires either combine into something greater or compete for oxygen until one suffocates. With another Fire sign, you'll experience the validation of being truly understood alongside the frustration of being equally matched. These relationships work when you have a shared mission bigger than both your egos. They fail when you're competing for the same fuel source or burning in opposite directions. In friendship, Fire-Fire bonds are your ride-or-die connections, the people who match your intensity without flinching. In romance, they're passionate but volatile—incredible peaks, devastating valleys.\n\nMost challenging combinations: Water signs (Rats, Pigs, sometimes Monkeys) control Fire in the elemental cycle. Water douses, cools, redirects your flames in ways that can feel like sabotage even when it's just self-preservation. Water's emotional depth and strategic indirectness frustrate your preference for direct heat and honest feedback. You see Water as manipulative; Water sees you as destructive. These relationships require immense maturity to work—you must learn that Water's cooling effect isn't rejection but balance, and Water must learn that your heat isn't aggression but authenticity. When both elements are evolved, Fire-Water combinations can be powerful: you provide warmth and vision, they provide depth and navigation. But undeveloped, you'll resent their dampening effect and they'll flee your scorching intensity.\n\nMetal signs (Monkeys, Roosters, Dogs in Metal years) present complex dynamics. You control Metal, which can make you attractive to Metal signs seeking transformation and direction. But Metal's rigidity and preference for established rules can frustrate your reformist fire. You want to melt and reshape; Metal wants to refine and preserve. With other Roosters especially, you'll experience the strange push-pull of same-animal pairing: deep recognition alongside sharp competition. Metal partners work best when they respect your vision enough to let you lead, and you respect their precision enough to incorporate their feedback.\n\nIn all relationships, you fight with the same tool you love with: fire. You bring passionate intensity to both conflict and connection. Your arguments are scorched-earth confrontations where you say the true thing that can't be unsaid. Your affection is equally intense—focused attention, high standards that prove you care enough to want their best, loyalty that burns away any threat to the relationship. You grow in relationships that can handle your heat without either combusting or shutting you down—partners who can say 'you're being too much right now' and have you actually hear it because they've earned that authority through demonstrated respect for your fire.",
  "elementalBalanceGuide": "Balancing Fire in a Rooster means managing the tension between your need to burn brightly and your finite fuel supply. You're not a self-sustaining flame—you're a controlled burn that requires feeding, tending, and occasional banking to avoid exhaustion. The signs of excess versus deficiency manifest in specific, observable ways, and your capacity for honest self-assessment (Rooster's gift) serves you here if you're willing to apply it to yourself as rigorously as you apply it to others.\n\nSigns of excess Fire: You're criticizing more than creating. Your standards have become weapons rather than aspirations. You feel constantly irritated by others' incompetence. You're sleeping poorly, overheating physically, experiencing inflammation or skin issues. Your mind races without productive direction. You're starting projects you don't finish because you're burning too hot to focus. You've recently burned bridges or delivered feedback that damaged relationships beyond your intention. Excess Fire makes you brittle, reactive, and ultimately less effective than your balanced self. You're all heat, no light.\n\nSigns of deficient Fire: You've lost your spark—the vision that normally drives you feels distant or irrelevant. You're going through motions without passion. Your criticism has turned inward into paralyzing perfectionism. You feel cold frequently, lack motivation, can't seem to generate enthusiasm even for things that normally ignite you. You're deferring to others' judgment when you used to trust your own. Deficient Fire turns your Rooster precision into fearful nitpicking without larger purpose. You're stuck in details because you've lost sight of why they matter.\n\nDaily practices for balance start with honoring Fire's natural rhythm. Fire rises and expands—your peak energy is mid-morning through afternoon, not late night. Align your most important work with these hours. Don't fight your circadian tendency toward morning sharpness; use it. Fire needs fuel, and for you that fuel is threefold: worthy challenges that engage your competence, visible progress toward your standards, and recognition from people you respect. Structure your days to include all three. When any one depletes, you notice the drag on your fire.\n\nPhysical practices matter more for Fire signs than you'd like to admit, given your preference for mental and social domains. Your element manifests in your body, and you cannot maintain balanced fire through willpower alone. Moderate cardiovascular exercise—not extreme intensity but sustained elevated heart rate—keeps your fire circulating rather than stagnating. Morning sunlight exposure feeds Fire's solar nature. You need it, especially in winter months when your element is elementally opposed by season.\n\nEnvironment adjustments are tactical. Your physical space should include southern-facing light if possible (Fire's direction). Use warm colors—reds, oranges, golds—in your workspace and wardrobe when you need to amplify confidence and boldness. When you're running too hot, introduce cooling elements strategically: blues and greens, water features, plants. Your environment should have visible order—Rooster cannot relax in chaos—but not sterile perfection. Some dynamic element, some flame that moves: candles, flowing fabrics, art that suggests motion.\n\nSeasonal awareness is crucial. Summer is your power season—Fire element in Fire season. This is when you launch, lead, push hardest. But it's also when you must watch for excess, for burning out yourself and others. Use summer's energy but build in recovery. Fall and winter are harder for you. As Fire's opposite season, winter will dampen your natural energy. Don't fight this with pure force; instead, adjust expectations. Winter is for planning, for building fuel for spring ignition, not for maximum output. Spring (Wood season) is excellent for you—Wood feeds Fire, so you'll feel energy rising naturally. Align major initiatives with spring launches when possible.\n\nLeveraging element cycles for growth means understanding the productive and controlling cycles at a practical level. When you need to generate Earth (create stable results, build lasting systems), increase your Fire intentionally: take bold action, speak publicly, set high standards, demand excellence. Your intensity produces the substance Earth signs and structures need. When you need to control Metal (reform rigid systems, challenge established rules, reshape structures), bring maximum heat: your Fire literally melts Metal into new forms. This is your moment for institutional change, for breaking and remaking rules.\n\nBut when facing Water (emotional complexity, strategic depth, adaptive challenges), recognize you're at elemental disadvantage. Don't try to overpower Water with more Fire—you'll just create steam and exhaust yourself. Instead, either remove yourself from Water-dominant situations or seek Wood allies who can grow between you and Water, creating bridges your Fire can cross. When experiencing Water seasons (winter) or Water-heavy people, bank your flames temporarily. This isn't surrender; it's strategy.\n\nYour growth edge as Fire Rooster is learning that not all problems require your heat, and not all excellence requires your standards. Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is tend a small, steady flame that lights the path for others without consuming all the oxygen in the room. Your fire at its best is a hearth, not a wildfire—warm enough to gather around, bright enough to see by, contained enough to last through the long night until dawn, when your Rooster nature will crow in the new day with justified pride."
