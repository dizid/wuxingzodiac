  "elementalIdentity": "You are the Metal Pig, and your existence is a study in contradictions that somehow make perfect sense. Metal brings precision, boundaries, and an almost surgical clarity to the Pig's naturally expansive, generous nature. Where other Pigs might give until they're depleted, you give with intention. Where they might trust blindly, you trust—but you verify. This isn't coldness; it's wisdom forged in the crucible of metal's refining fire. Your archetype, the Benevolent Stronghold, captures this perfectly: you are fortress and sanctuary simultaneously, a place where people feel both protected and truly seen.\n\nThe Pig energy in you wants connection, pleasure, abundance shared freely. The Metal element tempers this with discernment. You're not the Pig who says yes to everyone—you're the Pig who says yes to the right ones, and your 'no' is a complete sentence. This makes you rarer than you realize. Most Pigs leak energy through their porousness; your metal coating gives you a semi-permeable membrane. You can be in the world without being consumed by it. You feel deeply but don't drown. You care enormously but don't collapse.\n\nMetal Pigs often report feeling like outsiders even in Pig gatherings. Other Pigs might see you as too controlled, too boundaried. They're wrong, but they're also responding to something real: you have an inner authority they lack. Metal is the element of righteousness in Wu Xing philosophy—not self-righteousness, but a bone-deep knowing of what is correct, proper, aligned. Combined with Pig's moral compass, this makes you someone who cannot tolerate injustice, cannot abide cruelty, cannot stomach phoniness. You're allergic to bullshit in a way that can make social situations exhausting.\n\nThe stronghold imagery matters because you are genuinely built to last. Metal gives structure to Pig's sometimes formless generosity. You don't just want to help people; you want to build systems that help people. You think in frameworks and foundations. Where a Water Pig feels their way through life and a Wood Pig grows their way through it, you architect your way through. You're strategic in your kindness, which sounds calculating but isn't—it's actually the highest form of care. You understand that to give sustainably, you must give from a place of strength.\n\nYour shadow is obvious if you're honest: rigidity masquerading as principle. When your metal becomes too strong, you turn from stronghold to fortress, from protective to controlling. You can become so committed to your vision of how things should be that you stop seeing how things actually are. The Pig in you wants to trust; the Metal in you catalogs every betrayal and builds higher walls. This is your central tension and your life's work—remaining open while staying strong, being principled without becoming brittle. Every Metal Pig must learn that boundaries and walls are not the same thing.",
  "elementInDepth": "Metal in Wu Xing is not just iron or gold—it's the moment of crystallization, of essence distilled, of autumn's ruthless pruning that allows next spring's growth. For you as a Metal Pig, this manifests as an almost painful clarity about what matters. You see through pretense not because you're cynical but because metal conducts truth. It's an excellent conductor, remember—energetically, you're wired to transmit authenticity and receive it. Lies feel physically uncomfortable in your presence, which is why dishonest people often avoid you without knowing why.\n\nThe productive cycle is crucial for understanding your energetic mechanics. Metal generates Water in the cycle—your clarity and precision naturally flow into wisdom, intuition, deep rest. When you're functioning well, your Metal Pig nature creates conditions for profound emotional and spiritual depth. You're not just organized; you organize your life in service of meaning. Your routines aren't rigid; they're rituals that feed your soul. This is Metal Pig at its best—the discipline isn't the point, it's the container for something greater. You build the stronghold so that real life can happen inside it.\n\nBut here's what most Metal Pigs don't realize until they've burned out a few times: you're also being generated by Earth. Earth produces Metal in the cycle. Your strength, your boundaries, your capacity for discernment—all of it depends on whether you're nourishing the Earth element in your life. Earth is stability, groundedness, self-care that isn't negotiable. When you neglect Earth (skipping meals because you're busy helping others, not sleeping, pushing through exhaustion), your Metal becomes brittle. You get controlling instead of boundaried, critical instead of discerning, isolated instead of appropriately protected.\n\nMetal controls Wood in the destructive cycle, and this is where your power lives—but also your danger. Wood is growth, expansion, flexibility. You have a natural capacity to prune, to cut away what doesn't serve, to say \"this far and no further.\" This makes you an exceptional manager, an excellent editor of your own life and others'. But unchecked Metal destroys Wood entirely. You can become so good at cutting away excess that you prune back possibility itself. You can trim other people's wild growth until they're bonsai versions of themselves—beautiful, controlled, and fundamentally constrained.\n\nWhen your Metal is depleted, the Pig nature floods forward without boundaries. You become unable to say no, unable to protect your energy, unable to maintain the very structures that make you effective. Depleted Metal Pig looks like: saying yes when you mean no, letting people violate your boundaries because confrontation feels too hard, losing your edge and then resenting everyone for how soft you've become. You'll know your Metal is depleted when you start feeling powerless, victimized, or resentful—these aren't natural Pig states unless the protective element is compromised.\n\nStrong Metal, properly balanced with Earth and flowing into Water, makes you unstoppable. You're the person who builds institutions that outlast you, who creates abundance that others can depend on, who loves with both ferocity and wisdom. You're proof that strength and kindness aren't opposites—they're partners. But this only works when you're honest about what feeds your Metal (recognition, respect, evidence that your standards matter) and what depletes it (chaos, ingratitude, being taken for granted).",
  "yearAhead2026": "The Year of the Fire Horse is going to test every assumption you have about control, and that's exactly what you need. Fire melts Metal in the destructive cycle—this isn't catastrophic, it's refinement. The Horse brings speed, passion, and a fundamental wildness that will either terrify you or liberate you, depending on how tightly you're gripping. Fire wants to burn away your excess metal, your over-control, the parts of your stronghold that have become prison bars. Let it.\n\nQ1 (February through April 2026): The year opens with Fire energy challenging your structures immediately. You'll feel the impulse to tighten control—don't. This is the quarter for examining which of your boundaries are actually serving you and which are just habits. Horse energy is relational and moves in herds; you'll be pulled into more social situations than you typically prefer. Say yes more than feels comfortable. One of these connections will crack something open in you. Financially, resist the urge to over-plan. The Horse year rewards those who can pivot quickly, and your Metal nature wants to lock everything down six months in advance. Hold your plans loosely. A Fire-related industry or creative project could present unexpected opportunity—take the meeting even if it seems outside your wheelhouse.\n\nQ2 (May through July): This is your power quarter. Fire and Metal can work together when you understand that heat makes metal workable. You're being softened, not destroyed. This is when you'll feel the urge to make a significant change—in career, relationship, or living situation. The Horse energy will make it feel urgent; your Metal nature will want to slow down and analyze. Split the difference: move faster than usual but not recklessly. By July, you should have initiated something that scares you slightly. If you haven't, you're playing too safe and will regret it by year's end. Relationship-wise, this quarter brings heat—literal passion if you're open to it, or conflicts that finally clear the air if you've been avoiding difficult conversations.\n\nQ3 (August through October): The Horse year's intensity peaks mid-year, and you might feel exhausted. This is when your Earth element becomes critical. You need to ground deliberately and often—not as reward for productivity, but as the foundation of it. Your Metal will want to power through; resist this. Take the vacation, leave work at work, sleep more than you think you need to. Horse years burn through people who don't pace themselves. Career-wise, opportunities that seemed solid in Q2 might shift or dissolve—this isn't failure, it's Fire's nature. Stay flexible. Something better is forming. If you rigidify in disappointment, you'll miss it entirely. Watch for new people entering your life who seem chaotic but are actually exactly the medicine you need.\n\nQ4 (November through January 2027): The year closes with you different than you began it, if you've done this right. Fire will have burned away some of your rigidity. Horse will have taught you that not everything needs a plan. You'll end 2026 more alive and less controlled—this is victory, even if it feels uncomfortable. December specifically brings recognition or reward for risks taken earlier in the year. Your Metal nature wants proof that all this uncertainty was worth it; you'll get it. Use the year's final weeks to reflect on what you've learned about the relationship between strength and flexibility. Your stronghold should feel less like a fortress and more like a dojo—a place of discipline in service of mastery, not defense. Set intentions for 2027 based not on what you should do, but on what the year has shown you about who you're becoming.",
  "compatibilityMap": "Your elemental compatibility is more nuanced than most because Metal Pigs operate on two simultaneous frequencies: the Pig's warmth and the Metal's cool precision. People experience you as a paradox—approachable but boundaried, kind but exacting. This confuses some and intoxicates others.\n\nYour best elemental match is Earth signs (Earth Ox, Earth Dog, Earth Rabbit especially). Earth generates Metal, remember—these people literally feed your essential nature. With Earth partners and friends, you don't have to explain your need for structure. They get it. They won't push you to be more spontaneous than you're capable of being. Earth signs provide the stability that keeps your Metal strong, and they appreciate the protective boundary you create around the relationship. Romantically, Earth partnerships feel like coming home. You're both building something, and the sex has gravity to it—it's not just physical, it's foundational. The shadow: these relationships can become too stable, too predictable. You might wake up one day in a life that's perfectly organized but somehow lifeless. Guard against this by maintaining individual mystery.\n\nWater signs (Water Rat, Water Pig, Water Rabbit) are your energetic children—Metal generates Water in the cycle. These relationships feel natural because you're literally nourishing them with your energy. Water people appreciate your clarity because it gives shape to their fluidity. You provide the container; they provide the depth. In friendship, this is golden. In romance, it works if you're at a stage where you want to be the stronger partner, the provider of structure. The danger is depletion—you can give and give to Water partners until your own Metal is exhausted. Water people can also be energetically needy in ways that drain your resources. You'll know this is happening when you start to feel resentful or when you notice you're doing all the planning, all the decision-making, all the boundary-setting. In these relationships, you must insist that Water partners develop their own structure, not just borrow yours indefinitely.\n\nFire signs (Fire Horse, Fire Snake, Fire Tiger) are your elemental challenge—Fire melts Metal. These relationships feel intense, passionate, and slightly dangerous. Fire partners push you out of your comfort zone, which you need but also resist. In the bedroom, Fire brings heat that can crack open your controlled exterior. In conflict, Fire can wound your Metal nature by being too direct, too hot, too careless with words. These partnerships work when you're secure enough in yourself to be softened rather than threatened by Fire's intensity. They fail when you respond to Fire's heat by becoming more rigid, more controlling, more metallic. Fire signs will never be tamed by your stronghold—they'll either burn it down or leave. Your job is to stay in the heat without melting entirely. Time-limited relationships with Fire signs (passionate friendships, short-term romance) often work better than marriages unless you're both committed to growth.\n\nWood signs (Wood Rabbit, Wood Tiger, Wood Pig) are people you control in the cycle—Metal cuts Wood. This can manifest as you being the dominant partner, the decision-maker, the one who prunes their wild growth into manageable form. Some Wood signs appreciate this; they experience your Metal nature as clarifying. Others will feel stifled and eventually rebel. The healthiest Metal-Wood relationships are those where you consciously soften your cutting edge and let Wood be wild sometimes. If you're too Metal-dominant, you'll partner with Wood people and then slowly murder everything spontaneous in them. Watch for this. The telltale sign is when your Wood partner becomes passive, deferential, smaller than they used to be.\n\nOther Metal signs are mirrors—you'll either love what you see or hate it. Two Metal Pigs together can build an empire or destroy each other through mutual rigidity. There's respect but sometimes not enough softness. These work best when you both commit to nourishing your Earth element together—shared meals, shared routines, shared groundedness.",
  "elementalBalanceGuide": "Your elemental balance isn't about becoming less Metal—it's about ensuring your Metal remains strong without becoming brittle. The signs of excess Metal are unmistakable if you're paying attention: you become controlling, critical, inflexible. You find yourself unable to tolerate anyone else's mess, anyone else's process, anyone else's different way of doing things. You start believing your way is the only right way. Your stronghold becomes a fortress, and you're inside it alone. Excess Metal also shows up physically as tension—in your jaw, shoulders, chest. You're literally holding yourself too tightly.\n\nSigns of depleted Metal are equally clear: you lose your ability to say no. Your boundaries dissolve. You feel powerless and resentful. You say yes when you mean no and then hate everyone for taking what you offered. You become wishy-washy, unable to make decisions, unable to advocate for yourself. Other people's chaos becomes your chaos because you've lost your protective barrier. Depleted Metal Pig is tragic because you're strong by nature—seeing you weakened is like watching structural collapse.\n\nTo balance Metal, you must tend to Earth—the element that generates your strength. This is non-negotiable. Earth practices are: regular meals at regular times (this matters more for you than you think), physical contact with actual earth (gardening, walking barefoot, hands in soil), creating rhythm and routine in your daily life, yellow and earth-tone colors in your space, grounding practices like standing meditation or somatic work. When your Earth is strong, your Metal naturally strengthens without becoming excessive. You become boundaried without being rigid, clear without being harsh.\n\nYou also need to allow your Metal to flow into Water—the element you generate. This means making space for rest, reflection, depth. Water practices for you: adequate sleep (you need more than you think), time near actual water, allowing yourself to not be productive sometimes, creative expression that doesn't have a goal, therapy or deep conversation that goes beneath the surface. When you block the flow from Metal to Water, your Metal backs up and becomes excessive. You need to let your strength flow into wisdom, your discipline flow into depth.\n\nSeasonally, autumn is your power season—this is when your Metal nature is most supported by external energy. Use autumn to make important decisions, set structures for the year ahead, do your hardest work. You'll feel most yourself in autumn's clarity. Spring (Wood season) will feel challenging because Wood and Metal clash. In spring, consciously soften. Let others lead more. Don't prune so aggressively. Summer (Fire season) requires that you build in more rest because Fire will drain your Metal. Winter (Water season) should be your recovery time—this is when you replenish after autumn's expenditure.\n\nDaily practices that balance Metal Pig specifically: Morning routine that's consistent but not rigid—same shape, variable content. Something that honors structure without being imprisoned by it. Box breathing when you notice your jaw clenching or shoulders rising—this moves Metal energy that's stuck. Regular culling of possessions, relationships, commitments—Metal needs to cut away excess, so give it appropriate outlets. If you're not pruning your life regularly, you'll prune inappropriately (like cutting off people you actually need). Weekly practice of doing something unplanned—this keeps your Metal from calcifying. Let someone else decide. Say yes to something spontaneous. Eat the dessert before the meal. Small rebellions against your own structure keep you human.\n\nEnvironmentally, your space should have clean lines, excellent lighting, and a few specific objects that mean everything rather than many objects that mean little. Metal energy appreciates quality over quantity, precision over clutter. But include Earth elements—ceramics, stone, plants in soil—to keep yourself nourished. And include Water elements—a fountain, images of water, the color black—to remind yourself where your strength should flow. Your stronghold should feel like a place where depth is possible, not just order."
