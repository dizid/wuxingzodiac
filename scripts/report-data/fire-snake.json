  "elementalIdentity": "You are the Fire Snake — the Mesmerizing Flame. Not the bonfire that announces itself from miles away, but the blue-white heat at the core of the forge. Your fire doesn't crackle and pop for attention; it concentrates, intensifies, and transforms everything it touches. Where other fire signs blaze outward, you spiral inward, creating a magnetic pull that draws people toward you without you lifting a finger. This is the snake's genius: stillness that commands presence. Combined with fire's transformative nature, you become something rare — a catalyst who changes everything around you simply by existing in the room.\n\nThe snake brings patience, strategy, and an almost unsettling perceptiveness. You see through facades the way heat reveals structural weaknesses in metal. But you're not the cold, calculating Earth Snake or the philosophical Water Snake. Your fire element means you actually care — deeply, intensely, sometimes dangerously. You feel everything with solar intensity, but the snake in you has learned to keep that inferno hidden beneath cool, composed skin. People mistake your stillness for detachment. They have no idea you're burning alive inside, processing every slight, every possibility, every hidden motive in the room.\n\nThis combination makes you hypnotic. Fire wants to consume and transform. Snake wants to understand and penetrate beneath surfaces. Together, you become the person who sees exactly what someone needs to hear and delivers it with surgical precision. You're the flame that draws moths, but you're selective about who gets close enough to feel your heat. Most people get the cool, polished version — the snake's protective skin. Only the chosen few experience the full force of your fire, and that privilege is intoxicating.\n\nYour archetype isn't about raw power; it's about concentrated force. You're the laser versus the floodlight. The poison that kills precisely versus the bomb that destroys indiscriminately. Fire gives you passion and urgency; snake gives you timing and aim. When you finally strike — whether in business, love, or creative work — you do it with such focused intensity that people remember it for years. You don't just make impressions; you leave burns.\n\nBut here's what nobody tells you: this combination is exhausting. Maintaining that controlled burn takes enormous energy. Fire wants to explode; snake demands containment. You're constantly managing this internal pressure, which is why you need periods of complete withdrawal. Not because you're antisocial, but because you're literally cooling down your core temperature. People who don't understand this think you're moody or unreliable. You're neither. You're just operating on a different thermal cycle than everyone else, and pretending otherwise would burn you out entirely.",
  "elementInDepth": "Fire in the Wu Xing cycle is the apex of yang energy — peak summer, maximum expansion, pure transformation. It generates Earth (ash becomes soil) and controls Metal (heat melts iron). Fire is never neutral; it either creates or destroys. In you, this manifests as an inability to do anything halfheartedly. When you're interested, you're obsessed. When you're done, you're ice. There's no middle ground, and trying to find one only makes you irritable and scattered.\n\nFor the Fire Snake specifically, your elemental nature is complicated by the snake's yin tendency toward conservation and introspection. Classic fire signs like the Horse or Tiger express their element outwardly — they're the bonfire, the wildfire, the flame that needs oxygen and space. You're different. Your fire burns in an enclosed space, creating pressure, intensity, and heat that others can feel but not see. This is why people find you simultaneously attractive and unsettling. They sense enormous energy under perfect control, and humans are hardwired to be fascinated by that combination.\n\nWhen your fire is strong — when you're properly fueled by passion projects, meaningful connections, or creative challenges — you're unstoppable. You have the snake's strategic patience powered by fire's tireless drive. You can outwork anyone because you're not just disciplined; you're burning with purpose. Strong fire in your chart means you're generating Earth — you're productive, you create tangible results, you leave things better than you found them. People are drawn to your warmth and intensity. You become the person others orbit around, seeking your insight, your approval, your attention.\n\nBut depleted fire is your shadow state, and it's brutal. When your flame runs low — through exhaustion, disappointment, or too many people taking without giving back — you don't just get tired. You get cold. Calculating. The snake without fire's warmth is pure survival instinct. You withdraw completely, cutting people off with surgical precision. You become the flame that's burned down to embers: still dangerous, but now bitter and defensive. Depleted fire can't generate Earth, which means you stop being productive. Projects stall. Relationships calcify. You go through motions but feel nothing.\n\nHere's the cycle logic you need to understand: Fire controls Metal, which means your natural state is to melt through rigid structures, outdated systems, and artificial barriers. You're meant to be a reformer, a transformer, someone who burns away what's no longer useful. But Metal controls Wood in the cycle, and Wood feeds Fire. If you're spending all your energy controlling Metal — fighting systems, battling bureaucracy, managing difficult people — you're depleting the Wood that should be fueling you. This is why you crash so hard after big battles. You've burned through your fuel source.\n\nThe key is understanding that your fire needs Wood to sustain it — growth, expansion, new ideas, creative exploration. And your fire generates Earth — practical results, stable foundations, nourishment for others. When you're in cycle, you're fed by inspiration and you create lasting impact. When you're out of cycle, you're either starving (no Wood input) or constipated (generating no Earth output). Both states make you miserable, just in different ways.",
  "yearAhead2026": "2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse, and for you, Fire Snake, this is like having a wildfire tear through your carefully tended garden. The Horse is everything you're not — loud, external, scattered, impulsive. Same fire element, completely opposite expression. This year will challenge your controlled burn approach and force you to either adapt or double down on your natural tendencies. Neither option is easy, but understanding the energy helps you navigate it.\n\nThe Fire Horse year prioritizes speed over strategy, visibility over subtlety, action over contemplation. This runs counter to every instinct you have. Your fire burns slow and hot; the Horse's fire is fast and bright. The opportunity here is learning to occasionally let loose, to act before you've mapped every consequence, to be seen rather than mysteriously felt. The danger is burning out by trying to match an unsustainable pace, or alienating others by being the only person in the room refusing to join the stampede.\n\nQ1 (January-March) starts with pressure to declare yourself, to make grand gestures, to join collective enthusiasms. Resist the urge to retreat entirely, but be selective. Early in the year, Fire Horse energy is intoxicating but chaotic. Plant seeds — start projects, initiate conversations, make plans — but don't commit your full fire yet. You're assessing who can actually sustain intensity and who's just caught up in opening fireworks. Use the snake's perceptiveness while others are distracted by shiny beginnings. This is your intelligence-gathering quarter.\n\nQ2 (April-June) is when Fire Horse energy peaks, and you'll feel the strain. Too much external fire can actually deplete your internal reserves — it's like being too close to another heat source. You might feel pressured to perform, to match others' energy, to prove your commitment or passion. This is a trap. Instead, focus on generating Earth. Produce tangible results, create stable systems, build something lasting while others are still running around. Let them have the spotlight; you're building the stage. Warning: watch for relationship conflicts with Fire and Wood element people who want you to be more spontaneous or transparent than feels safe.\n\nQ3 (July-September) brings exhaustion to the collective, but this is actually your power season. Summer is fire's natural home, but by mid-year, the Horse's scattered approach has burned out most people. You, with your capacity for sustained heat, now have the advantage. This is when you strike — launch the project, make the move, claim the position. Everyone else is tired; you're just getting warmed up. The Fire Horse year has cleared away competition and revealed who's serious. Now you work with concentrated force while others recover.\n\nQ4 (October-December) is about banking gains and preparing for the transition to 2027's Fire Goat year. The Horse energy starts to fade, people start getting reflective, and your natural mode comes back into favor. Focus on consolidating relationships, documenting what you've learned, and identifying what needs to be released before the new year. The Fire Goat will reward depth and community — very different from Horse's individualism. Use Q4 to rebuild your Wood reserves: rest, explore new ideas, seek inspiration without pressure to immediately produce. You're not being lazy; you're ensuring your fire has fuel for the next cycle.",
  "compatibilityMap": "Your compatibility isn't about which animal signs get along — that's surface-level nonsense. What matters is elemental dynamics and whether someone can handle your particular frequency of fire. You need people who either fuel you (Wood), absorb your heat productively (Earth), or respect your intensity without trying to extinguish it (Water, but only in specific doses).\n\nBest matches are Wood element people — Tiger, Rabbit, certain Dragons. They feed your fire naturally, bringing growth, optimism, and expansion without demanding you change your fundamental nature. Wood people give you ideas to burn through, projects to fuel your passion, and they appreciate intensity without feeling threatened by it. With Wood partners, you feel fed rather than drained. The relationship has momentum. You're creating something together, and your fire transforms their growth into tangible results. Romantically, Wood people can handle your heat because they need it to flourish. They don't take your withdrawals personally because they're busy growing themselves.\n\nEarth element people — Ox, Dragon (some), Dog, Goat — are complicated. Fire generates Earth, which means you naturally nourish them, but it's often one-directional. Earth partners provide stability, grounding, and practical support. They appreciate your intensity and benefit from your transformative energy. But here's the problem: you can exhaust yourself constantly generating Earth with no reciprocal fueling. Romantically, Earth signs feel safe and sustainable until you realize you've been giving endlessly and receiving only stability in return. Stability isn't nothing, but it doesn't feed your fire. These relationships work best when the Earth person has strong Wood in their chart too, creating a cycle where they grow (Wood) and you help them build (generating Earth).\n\nWater element people — Rat, Pig, certain Monkeys — are your natural controllers in the Wu Xing cycle. Water controls Fire, which means these relationships have built-in power dynamics. Sometimes you need this. Water signs can cool your intensity when you're overheating, provide emotional depth when you're burning too externally focused. But weak Water people will try to extinguish you entirely, mistaking your fire for a threat rather than a force to be directed. Strong Water people understand they're not meant to put you out; they're meant to channel you. These relationships require enormous maturity on both sides. Romantically, Water signs see through your snake composure to the fire beneath, which is both intimate and terrifying.\n\nMetal element people — Monkey, Rooster, certain Dogs — are interesting because you control them in the Wu Xing cycle. Fire melts Metal. This can manifest as you naturally breaking through their rigid structures, forcing them to transform and adapt. Metal people respect strength, precision, and competence — all things you have. But they also resist change and cling to systems, which frustrates your transformative nature. These relationships often involve you constantly proving yourself or battling for dominance. Romantically, Metal signs are attracted to your intensity but want to contain and shape it. This works only if they understand they're the crucible, not the blacksmith.\n\nOther Fire signs deserve special mention. Fire-Fire relationships are either extraordinary or catastrophic. Another Fire Snake would understand you completely but might mirror your patterns too exactly — double withdrawal, double intensity, nobody willing to be vulnerable first. Fire Horse or Fire Tiger would clash with your controlled approach; they'd call you cold, you'd call them reckless. Fire Pig or Fire Rabbit might work because their fire expresses differently, creating heat diversity rather than competition. The key question with any Fire person: does their flame feed yours, or do you compete for oxygen?",
  "elementalBalanceGuide": "Balancing your fire isn't about dampening it — that's the worst thing you could do. It's about understanding your fuel sources, your outputs, and your cycles so you burn clean and sustainable rather than flaring out or smoldering into nothing. You're not trying to be less intense; you're trying to be strategically intense.\n\nSigns of excess fire: insomnia despite exhaustion, rage that feels disproportionate, obsessive thought loops you can't cool down, skin feeling hot or flushed, craving cold food and drinks constantly, pushing people away because their needs feel like demands, starting fights to release pressure. Excess fire happens when you're all output with no input, burning hotter and hotter with nothing to show for it. The snake's instinct is to coil tighter, which only increases internal pressure. You need controlled release.\n\nTo address excess: introduce Water element strategically, not to extinguish but to create steam — transformation with release. This means emotional expression (not just intellectualizing), creative work that actually completes and releases (not endless planning), physical practices that make you sweat (hot yoga, intense cardio, sauna). You need to burn through the backlog. Also critical: generate Earth. Produce something tangible. Finish projects. Create order from chaos. When fire generates Earth properly, it releases pressure naturally. Excess fire often means you're spinning in transformation without creating results.\n\nSigns of deficient fire: depression masquerading as wisdom, inability to care about things that used to matter, cold extremities despite warm environment, choosing isolation out of numbness rather than recovery, cynicism as default mode, watching life rather than participating, analysis paralysis. Deficient fire happens when you've burned through all available Wood (inspiration, growth, new ideas) and have nothing left to sustain the flame. The snake's instinct is to go dormant, which works short-term but becomes a prison.\n\nTo address deficiency: you need Wood element immediately. New experiences, creative exploration with zero pressure to produce, conversations with people who inspire rather than drain you, learning something just for curiosity, time in nature (literal Wood), expansion activities that feel like play. Stop generating Earth for a while. Stop trying to be productive or useful. Your fire needs fuel before it can create anything. Also: morning sunlight, bright colors, social engagement in small doses, saying yes to invitations even when you'd rather stay home.\n\nDaily practices for balance: Morning ritual that honors fire — not exercise necessarily, but something that acknowledges your intensity. This could be journaling about what you're burning for, lighting a candle with intention, or simply sitting with coffee and allowing yourself to feel want instead of need. Midday check-in: are you burning clean or smoking? Clean burn feels focused and energized. Smoking feels scattered and irritable. Evening release: complete something, anything, so you're generating Earth daily. A finished email, a cleaned space, a cooked meal. Your nervous system needs evidence that fire creates results.\n\nEnvironment adjustments: Your space should have fire (candles, warm lighting, reds and oranges in art) and Earth (pottery, stone, stable furniture, plants in soil) but also strategic Water (a small fountain, bathroom as sanctuary, dark blue accents) and Wood (living plants, wood furniture, books and creativity materials visible). Avoid metal-heavy spaces — too much chrome, glass, and hard edges will feel cold and constraining.\n\nSeasonal awareness: Summer is your power season, but it's also when you're most likely to overheat. Use it for major output and visibility, but schedule recovery. Fall (Metal season) will feel restrictive and critical — focus on refinement rather than fighting. Winter (Water season) is for rest and emotional depth; don't force productivity. Spring (Wood season) is for gathering fuel — say yes to new ideas, start things without finishing them, explore. You're preparing for summer's burn. Understanding your fire follows seasonal cycles helps you work with your nature instead of against it. You're not meant to burn at the same intensity year-round. Neither is anyone else, but for you, trying to maintain constant heat is the fastest path to depletion. Honor the cycle. Your fire will still be there when it's needed."
